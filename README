# Artigo


## What is Artigo?
Artigo (Portuguese for Article) is a blog engine written in Ruby[1] running on the Rails[2] web platform.


## Installing Artigo

open a terminal (or command line) to the directory that contains Artigo. 

	\> rake artigo:setup

this will create some security values in the /config/initializers/ directory. It's okay, this is required for Artigo to
work correctly.

After this is done, you'll need to initialize your database. Do this by entering:

	\> rake db:reset

your database will now be created. You can test your Artigo site by entering

	\> ruby script\server
