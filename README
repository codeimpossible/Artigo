open a terminal (or command line) to the directory that contains Artigo. 

{{{
	\> rake artigo:setup
}}}

this will create some security values in the /config/initializers/ directory. It's okay, this is required for Artigo to
work correctly.

After this is done, you'll need to initialize your database. Do this by entering:

{{{
	\> rake db:reset
}}}

your database will now be created. You can test your Artigo site by entering

{{{
	\> ruby script\server
}}}
