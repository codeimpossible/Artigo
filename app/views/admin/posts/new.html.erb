		<p>Your main body should fully realize the ideas you set into motion in the introduction section. Keep your posts short
		and to the point as shorter blog posts are easier to read and remember.</p>

		<p>Use a consistent style in your writing, once you've picked a style that suites you and your audience, stick to it.</p>

		<p>Be your own editor. Before you publish your post, go back and re-read it. Does it sound like you? Does it make sense? Does it get right to the point?</p>
