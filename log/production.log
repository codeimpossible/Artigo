I briefly glanced at the covers and saw some interesting things. The very first thing I noticed was that one issue had, on the cover, an image of the Master Chief from Halo3 with \"XNA: Ready for Prime Time?\" in a huge, bold font. The other front page bullets for that issue indicated that the issue focused intensely on XNA and game development. The second thing I noticed was that the other issue included a \"13-step Crash Course for Using LINQ\".\n\nI tried desperately to hide the drool that had started to form at the corners of my mouth as I said \"Sure, I think these might be alright\". So I stuffed them into my backpack like a theif with a fist full of unmarked bills and headed home. I just got done reading both issues and enjoyed their content, albeit one more than the other, so much that I felt compelled to note it here.\n\nI figure I would go over them in order of their publication (one covers July/August, the other September/October).\n\nJuly / August (vol. 8, issue 4)\nSadly this is the issue that I was least impressed with. Not because it was a \"horrible\" publication. it just didn\'t cover as many topics that interested me as the other issue. In fact it only covered one. Linq. Linq is Microsofts\' latest \"wow\" feature for .NET 3.5 (codename: \"Orcas\") and is quite possibly the coolest god damned thing I have ever seen but since this is just a review of a magazine I\'ll save my fanfare for LINQ for another day. The article, for those interested can be found <a href=\"http://www.code-magazine.com/Article.aspx?quickid=0707051\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\n\nSeptember / October (vol. 8, issue 5)\nThis issue had a lot to offer that interested me.

It\'s part and parcel of the whole office gig. It\'s easy to get caught up in the all the drama that is going on at work \"Did you hear that Josh and Tina are an item now?\", \"I heard we are all going to be working for Herbert next week!\", etc. We are all gossipers. Even those that seem impervious to the gossip will eventually find themselves caught up in it if they are not careful.<!--more-->\n\n<img src=\"http://www.ksl.com/emedia/slc/133/13352/1335293.jpg\" height=\"250\" width=\"250\" /> Basic tips for surviving the rumor mill are pretty simple and follow common sense pretty strictly. First off, just because rumors and gossip are generally more closely associated with women don\'t let this fool you. Men are just as guilty of gossip and in my own experiences just as bad or worse at getting caught up in the rumors flying around. Some people are more easily caught up when they hear something from Jon than if they had heard the same thing from Samantha. Don\'t let this fool you. When it comes to rumors trust no one.\n\nThe rumor mill has no age limit. People of any age can get wrapped up in the rumor mill. Don\'t trust the more experienced ad executive simply because he is older. That doesn\'t mean he has more experience than anyone else with the rumor mill.\n\nWhen you hear a rumor take it with a grain of salt. Remember that game you played in kindergarten where all the kids sat in a circle and one child whispered a phrase to their neighbor and that child whispered what they heard to their neighbor and so on and so on? Remember how the result was completely different than the phrase at the beginning? Well the rumor mill is simply this principle put into practice on a larger (or smaller) scale.\n\nDon\'t react. When someone presents you with a rumor that is particularly inflammatory resist the urge to react in the moment. Take a breath, dismiss yourself from the conversation, go for a walk, get some water or coffee do anything but react. If your team is going to be transferred to Herberts\' reign then it is going to happen. There is nothing you can do about it now the best thing that can be done is to try to establish a working relationship with Herbert or polish your resume.\n\nIt\'s easy to get caught up in the rumor mill but it is not impossible to avoid. Remember to take all rumors with a grain of salt, and to never react to a rumor in the moment and you will discover you have what it takes to survive the office rumor mill.', '2011-05-01 02:48:34', 0, '')[0m

Ugh.)\n\nWhen we arrived at Phoenix airport we were absolutely starving. We were ready for a burger, some fries, onion rings, a side order of pizza anything we could get our hands on really. However, we completely forgot about the timezone change. Our bodies were saying that it was lunch time but everyone was still serving breakfast. Hungry, we left the terminal and vowed to get lunch ASAP on the way to our hotel.\n\n<img src=\"http://lh5.google.com/pistalwhipped/RykmfZvujMI/AAAAAAAAAkI/dn-wd9NzS3g/s288/DSC02155.JPG\" align=\"left\" height=\"216\" hspace=\"6\" vspace=\"4\" width=\"288\" />The commute was uneventful. We were completely awestruck by the landscape and I couldn\'t believe we seemed so far away from home. We were already starting to relax and forget all the crap we left at home. Except for the cats of course. I set up a web-cam before we left to upload pictures of the cats at intervals to the ftp server we have. The cats must have known about the camera because we were only able to spot <a href=\"http://wiki.pistalwhipped.net/pmwiki.php?n=Bios.Shiva\" target=\"_blank\">Shiva</a> on the next to last day of our trip.\n\nBack to the trip. We arrived at the Carefree Resort around noon-time and our first impression was that the name fit this place very well. We checked in, went to our villa and spent the rest of the day getting familiar with the surrounding area (and the couch).\n\nOn the second day we visited the Out of Africa zoo and got to see some really amazing animals up close. There was a great spotted leopard there that even though it only had three legs it could still completely ravage anyone of the visitors. That leopard was a complete bad-ass. It lost it\'s leg when it was a cub because it tried to smack a lion (yeah, a lion) that was in a cage next to it and the lion mangled it\'s limb so bad that it had to be removed.\n<p align=\"right\"><img src=\"http://lh5.google.com/pistalwhipped/RykmbZvujII/AAAAAAAAAjo/tJc_eaFvgQ4/s288/DSC02132.JPG\" align=\"right\" height=\"216\" hspace=\"4\" vspace=\"4\" width=\"288\" /></p>\nWe also saw a demonstration called \"Tiger Splash\" which was one of the most amazing things I\'ve seen. Zoo personnel running around with Bengal tigers trying to get the tigers to chase them around. The human performers would pretend to be wounded animals (walking on all fours, dragging a leg) and when the tigers would chase them they would run and jump into a 4 foot deep pool that was located in the center of the ring. It was spectacular!\n\nOn our third day we hiked up Pinnacle peak (about 2400 ft up) and took in the view. Another excellent day. The hike wasn\'t strenuous at all and we got to see some really amazing scenery along the way. It felt more like a park than a hiking trail, there were people jogging up the peak as well as entire families just hanging out at the rest areas.\n\nI am completely in love with the state of Arizona and everyone has asked me when we are moving out there.

Why, oh why must we constantly include the runat=\"server\" attribute in our custom and pre-compiled web control declarations? To me it seems like this is unnecessary bloat that could be re-tooled to save developers more time and reduce headaches caused by forgetting it\'s inclusion.<!--more-->\n\nI\'m not asking for the runat=\"server\" attribute to be removed. Not at all. I\'m just stating that I think it was implemented in an inconvenient way and should be re-thought and re-designed. A blogger named <a href=\"http://www.mikeschinkel.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Mike Schinkel</a> posed <a href=\"http://www.mikeschinkel.com/blog/whyrunatserverforaspnet/\" target=\"_blank\">the same question</a> and a commenter replied:\n<blockquote>I understand your point, but the importance of [runat=\"server\"] is more for consistency and extensibility. If the developer has to mark some tags some ways (ie an \"asp:\" prefix) and in other cases using runat, then it creates more confusion. Also, this simplifies what is sent directly to the user agent as a Response.Write and what needs to be parsed by the ASP.NET engine. What if some user agent of the future has a name collision with one of the ASP.NET tags, it would be difficult otherwise to tell ASP.NET to ignore a tag.</blockquote>\n<strong>\"..is more for consistency and extensibility.\"</strong>\n<blockquote>\"Consistency is the last refuge of the unimaginative.\"\n- Oscar Wilde</blockquote>\nI\'m not sure why this person chose to argue consistency as one of his main points but it\'s a poor choice. He may as well have just said \"it is just done this way\". The runat attribute is required on all custom, pre-compiled or otherwise included web controls so why must it be specifically declared? Think about it in programming terms. If you have a literal string or integer littered throughout a class or function how likely would it be for you to replace that with a declared variable? I would do it 99% of the time.\n\n<strong>\"...this simplifies what...needs to be parsed by the ASP.NET engine.\"</strong>\n\nOkay, apparently they (Microsoft) have never heard of Regular Expressions? Why must we specifically tell the ASP.NET engine which controls are server controls when the work is already done via the Page\\Controls section of the web.Config when we include a control library? This seems overly redundant to me and reeks of poor implementation. The runat=\"server\" attribute is more like a legacy feature from 1.0 that for one reason or another (probably it\'s deep integration with the compiler and rendering engine) has not been removed yet.', '2011-05-01 02:48:34', 0, '')[0m

The main issues were that my \"Split post with More tag\" button was missing and the \"Code\" tab in the MCE no longer worked. I fixed both of these issues by performing the following edits:\n\n<!--more-->\n\n1. look for a line that equals:\n<blockquote>&lt;?php\n$my_drafts = get_users_drafts($user_ID);</blockquote>\n2. Just before this line paste:\n<blockquote>&lt;script src=\"&lt;?php echo get_option(\'siteurl\') ?&gt;/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/editor_plugin.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</blockquote>\nThis fix, apparently, only solved my problems for posting a new article. When I saved a draft and later brought it up for editing my previous problems reared their ugly heads once again. This is due to wordpress using different pages for editing drafts and starting a new article, which seems like an odd choice to me. Why wouldn\'t you save these kinds of hassles by using one page to handle both requests? Okay, I\'m starting to ramble, back to the problem.\n\nIn order to fix the same problems I was having in my post-new.php file in the post.php file the edits are essentially the same (one additional new line must be added) they just occur in different areas.\n\n1. In the post.php file locate the line that reads:\n<blockquote>case \'edit\':</blockquote>\n2. After that line locate a line that reads:\n<blockquote>wp_enqueue_script(\'prototype\');</blockquote>\n3. just after that line paste:\n<blockquote>wp_enqueue_script(\'interface\');</blockquote>\n4. after the line you just pasted locate a line that looks like:\n<blockquote>require_once(\'admin-header.php\');</blockquote>\n5. paste the following code after the line above:\n<blockquote>?&gt;\n&lt;script src=\"&lt;?php echo get_option(\'siteurl\') ?&gt;/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/editor_plugin.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;?php</blockquote>\nNow save the files and upload them to your wp-admin directory and you should now be able to edit via the MCE problem free. I am not sure why these edits must be made and also why this isn\'t something that others have had to encounter as well. My search on WordPress.org\'s support site yielded few results so if anyone out there has had these problems and solved them another way please drop a comment.\n\n<em><strong>Update:</strong></em> I completely missed the Page.php and Page-New.php files. Here are the steps to correct the problems with those files.\n\nFor the Page.php file:\n\n1. find the line that equals:\n<blockquote>require_once(\'admin-header.php\');</blockquote>\n2. after this line paste:\n<blockquote>?&gt;\n&lt;script src=\"&lt;?php echo get_option(\'siteurl\') ?&gt;/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/editor_plugin.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;?php</blockquote>\nFor the Page-New.php file:\n\n1. find the line that equals:\n<blockquote>&lt;?php if ( (isset($_GET[\'posted\']) &amp;&amp; $_GET[\'posted\'])  || isset($_GET[\'saved\'])  ) : ?&gt;</blockquote>\n2. before this line paste:\n<blockquote>&lt;script src=\"&lt;?php echo get_option(\'siteurl\') ?&gt;/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/editor_plugin.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</blockquote>', '2011-05-01 02:48:34', 0, '')[0m

The main feature that drew me to the open source browser was the that it supported user-generated plugins. I downloaded FF and stumbleupon and I was hooked. Since then I\'ve tried dozens of plugins and some have made me wonder how I used the internet before they came along (like stumbleupon and googlepedia) while some have made me wonder simply \"why?\".\n\n<!--more-->\n\nThe list below is comprised of the former type of plugin. These are the plugins that I could not imagine getting through my day-to-day routine without.\n\n1. StumbleUpon (<a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/138\" target=\"_blank\">download</a>)\nI honestly cannot remember which site or person turned me on to SU but whomever did is evil. SU is the most addictive experience I have been a part of since World of Warcraft. It is the perfect marriage of user generated content within an online community and it symbolizes Web 2.0 perfectly.\n\n2. Google Reader Notifier (<a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3977\" target=\"_blank\">download</a>)\nThe premise for this plugin is simple. If you have a Google Reader account this plugin will scan your incoming articles and alert you to how many you have and in what folder they are stored.\n\n3. GooglePedia (<a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2517\" target=\"_blank\">download</a>)\nI\'m not sure why this plugin isn\'t offered by Google. It will take your google search query and run it against Wikipedia and embed the most relevant article into the search results page. This plugin can slow down the loading of the results page (but it can be disabled easily by clicking the \'hide googlepedia link\').\n\n4. Morning Coffee (<a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2677\" target=\"_blank\">download</a>)\nFor me this plugin is more like after dinner cocktail. I use this plugin more at night to catch up on google reader, twitter, the blog, gmail and other websites without having to remember them.\n\n5. CustomizeGoogle &amp; GooglePreview (<a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/743\" target=\"_blank\">download</a>) &amp; (<a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/189\" target=\"_blank\">download</a>)\nI probably should have included all the google-based plugins together but oh well. CustomizeGoogle is perfect at removing unwanted ads from the search results page while GooglePreview does an excellent job at showing me the page I am about to navigate to beforehand.\n\n6. FoxyTunes (<a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/219\" target=\"_blank\">download</a>)\nWhat can I say, this plugin will handle Windows Media Player and iTunes but it will also handle more obscure media sources like Pandora, MusikCube, Las.fm and even Xbox Media Center. Plus it will embed your \"currently listening to\" in your blog or forum posts.\n\n7. Download Statusbar (<a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/26\" target=\"_blank\">download</a>)\nWhen I downloaded Firefox I was very happy that it eliminated the annoying download status window that plagues IE to this very day. But I eventually grew tired of having to hide and show this window to check on long downloads. Enter the Download Statusbar plugin. This baby creates a small, unobtrusive taskbar within FF that displays your current (and past) downloads. It will even color-code them by download speed!\n\n8. Firebug (<a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1843\" target=\"_blank\">download</a>)\nEvery web developer needs this plugin. I wish with every ounce of my soul that IE had a plugin like this. Firebug has solved many a javascript/css/html nightmare for me (even those I encountered only in IE). This plugin can cause some sites to run slowly but it can be disabled very easily.', '2011-05-01 02:48:34', 0, '')[0m

Out of all of those, I had the least trouble with wordpress. However I still had to download a plugin that wasn\'t supported by wordpress and I wasn\'t sure if it would be around after six months.\n\nThe gallery function in WP 2.5 is excellent. My only gripe is that it seems to take a while for my uploaded pictures to show up in the gallery tab but I assume this is just due to excessive load on the server.\n<h3>Writing</h3>\nThe new editor is excellent. I am very happy with the full-screen mode. It allows me to focus on what I am typing which makes editing and reviewing that much easier. When not in fullscreen mode the UI of the writing page is just like the rest of wordpress. It just feels right.\n<h3>Speed</h3>\nWordpress 2.5 <em>feels</em> faster. I\'d have to have my old 2.3.3 version of WP back to do a comparison (please no!) but 2.5 just feels faster to me. All the pages respond snappily and posting doesn\'t take as long as it used to.\n\nThe WP team has definitely set the bar for all other blog platforms and they\'ve set it pretty damn high. <a title=\"Katz Web Design Review of WordPress 2.5\" href=\"http://katzwebdesign.wordpress.com/2008/04/04/wordpress-dot-com-finally-updates-to-2-point-5-a-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Katz Web Design</a> asked \"<em>who would want to use Blogger.com?</em>\" and I think that is the perfect question.

Lets break it out into segments for easier reading.\n<pre>0 [0x01] \n1 [05] \n2 [000000000005] \n3 [15000000] \n4 [F2EBB914] \n5 [9329116C] \n6 [5E352836] \n7 [0E040000]</pre>\nSegments 0 through 2 are used by Windows to validate the SID. 0 is the version number of the SID; currently, all Windows operating systems use \"1\" as the version. 1 tells us that there are 7 segments in this SID (number of dashes minus 2). Segment 2 states that this sid has a top level authority of 5 which equals <strong>SECURITY_NT_AUTHORITY</strong>. (for a better description of what each security authority does please see <a title=\"Well-known SIDs\" href=\"http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa379649(VS.85).aspx\" target=\"_blank\">this KB article</a>)\n\nSegments 3 through 6 are little-endian 32-bit integers that describe the issuer of the SID. 7 is a 32-bit little-endian integer called the \"Relative ID\". This value is the id of the user on the machine that issued the SID. It is important to remember that these values are stored as little-endians because this will factor in when we translate them into the final SID.\n\nthe first part of the sid is the easiest to translate. In our example sid above the first 3 segments become \"S-1-5\" because every sid is prefixed with \"S\" and we drop segment 3 as it is only used in validation. The next part is where we translate the machine id and user id and this can be confusing when done for the first time. Since the values are stored in little-endian format we have to reverse the order of the bits so:\n<ul>\n	<li><strong>15000000 </strong>becomes 00000015 which translates to (hex to dec) 21</li>\n	<li><strong>F2EBB914 </strong>becomes 14b9eb2f which translates (hex to dec) to 347728882</li>\n	<li><strong>9329116C</strong> becomes 6c112993 which translates (hex to dec) to 1813064083</li>\n	<li><strong>5E352836</strong> becomes 3628355E which translates (hex to dec) to 908604766</li>\n</ul>\nNow we have our machine identifier and our SID is now\n<pre>S-1-5-21-347728882-1813064083-908604766</pre>\nAll we have to do now is translate the user id which follows the same process as the machine id so:\n<ul>\n	<li><strong>0E040000</strong> becomes 0000040e which translates (hex to dec) to 1038</li>\n</ul>\nSo we are all done and our final sid is:\n<pre>S-1-5-21-347728882-1813064083-908604766-1038</pre>', '2011-05-01 02:48:34', 0, '')[0m

I got my start hacking away in Visual Basic back in 1995 and didn\'t do any sort of development for money until 2004. Yeah I\'ve only been a software developer for 4 years now. It\'s sort of scary being a noob in real life. There is a lot to learn: the culture, what to say, what to do and most importantly what not to say and what not to do.\n\nThe hardest lesson I\'ve had to learn is to not be afraid of the words \"<em>I don\'t know</em>\". I used to assume I knew the answer to everything or that I was expected to know the answer. I was wrong. Nobody has all the answers and those people that seem to either A) are being asked the right questions or B) are making it up.\n\nIt\'s hard looking your boss in the face and saying that you don\'t know the answer to whatever he/she is asking you but it\'s even harder to say it later or worse: when he/she finds out on their own.\n\nAnother thing I\'ve learned that you never say \"yes\" under pressure. Ever. If someone comes to you to ask you for something and you are occupied or in a rush then simply say so. Say \"I\'m really busy right now, give me some time to come up with an accurate assessment\".\n\nIf the person needed the estimate 5 minutes ago then qualify your response: \"I\'ll need more time to get you an accurate assessment but my best guess right now would be...\". This can really save you some stress further down the line.\n\nAlso, Read. Read everything. Read blogs, MSDN Articles, newsgroups, magazines (\"Code\" is pretty good) and most importantly books. Programming books have almost fallen off the list of a programmers best learning tools but not entirely. I\'ve learned almost as much from books as I have from actually writing code.

If you can fix it fast do it, otherwise root out code smell and refactor in your down-time.</li>\n	<li>XXXX technology isn\'t always the answer. Be pragmatic. Solve problems as easily as possible. We exist to reduce and handle complexity in non-complex ways.</li>\n	<li>Open source is a good thing.</li>\n	<li>Contribute to or start an open source project. Extra XP and a good resume bullet.</li>\n	<li>Did I mention test, test, test, test.</li>\n	<li>Only re-invent what you absolutely have to. Would you rather spend a week implementing and testing your own GridView or install a commercial control in a day?</li>\n	<li>It\'s not the hours you put in, it\'s what you do with them. Refactor your own development process.

No luck. Chkdsk couldn\'t initialize on the drive in question. Uh oh. I rebooted and crossed my fingers.\n\nAfter a while the server came back online and I went back in over RDP.

The 80gb of data included almost everything we use including:\n\n \n<ul>\n	<li>Software Downloads</li>\n	<li>Our in-house SVN Repository</li>\n	<li>Code files from years past (not in SVN)</li>\n	<li>All of our Music</li>\n	<li>All of our Pictures</li>\n	<li>Various Documents (tax documents, important medical stuff etc)</li>\n</ul>\n \n\n<span> </span>\n\nBasically everything you wouldn\'t want to lose right? \n\n<em>\"No problem\"</em>, I thought.

Or so I thought.\n\nAfter Windows was done I started by re-creating all the shares on the cleared drive. I began installing SVN from scratch, setting up our repositories again and getting ready to re-check-in my code from my main pc.\n\nDuring this process I started moving directories around on my main pc and got confused about what folders had what in them and I eventually ended up deleting all the code on that machine in one key stroke. I immediately knew what I had done but I kept my cool.\n\n<em>\"It\'s still cool. I have the backups. I\'ll be a day behind but I\'ll have my code\"</em>.\n\nSo I restore the backup from the Mozy download and start browsing the repository from my main pc. One problem though, I\'m not seeing any code newer than 12/07/2008. This can\'t be. I wrote a nightly backup script!\n\nAfter checking the script I realized my problem. Yes, I had written the backup script to run nightly and yes, it was running every night but it wasn\'t overwriting the old backup data because the files were protected. \n\nNow at this point I am beyond devastated. I\'ve just committed the cardinal sin in computers. I assumed my backups would work and never fully tested them. I am, for lack of a better term, completely screwed.\n\nSince then I\'ve run a whole slew of data recovery tools on both machines with no luck. My data is gone. A good month and a half of up-till-4am coding sessions completely gone.\n\nTest all the time and test everything.

Some things have changed since then and I\'ve tried to keep the post up-to-date. Enjoy!</em>\n\n<em>Also, another similar library has come out recently: <a href=\"http://www.codeplex.com/jsinq\" target=\"_blank\">JSINQ</a> which is a really feature-rich LINQ to Object implementation in Javascript. Really bad-ass stuff.</em></blockquote>\nThe Elevator Pitch:\n\nJSOQ is an open-source pet project of mine that lets you easily access the data that you need from large collections in JavaScript. It was developed over a two week period in September of 2008 and is currently at version 1.1.\n\nEveryone probably just shrugged and said \"so??\" Well let me show you. \n\nLets assume that you have the following JSON string from another web application like, say <a title=\"Twitter search results in JSON\" href=\"http://search.twitter.com/search.json?q=codeimpossible\" target=\"_blank\">twitter search results</a> for example:\n\n<pre class=\"brush:javascript\">\n{\"results\":[\n{\n\"text\":\"Just another day at the office\",\n\"to_user_id\":null,\n\"from_user\":\"codeimpossible\",\n\"id\":1194587890,\n\"from_user_id\":1316793,\n\"iso_language_code\":\"en\",\n\"profile_image_url\":\"www.path.to.image.us\",\n\"created_at\":\"Tue, 10 Feb 2009 05:47:33 +0000\"\n},\n{\n\"text\":\"@spolsky thats easy! http:\\/\\/tinyurl.com\\/2z42bs\",\n\"to_user_id\":1357501,\n\"to_user\":\"spolsky\",\n\"from_user\":\"codeimpossible\",\n\"id\":1194582705,\n\"from_user_id\":1316793,\n\"iso_language_code\":\"en\",\n\"profile_image_url\":\"www.path.to.image.us\",\n\"created_at\":\"Tue, 10 Feb 2009 05:44:51 +0000\"\n}\n]} \n</pre>\n\nIn the sample above we only have two results but JSOQ has been tested to work with collections of tens of thousands of items.\n\nThe JSON object we have here is perfectly fine if we watned to show a whole bunch of data to the end user, but what if I only wanted to show the search results after a certain date? Or what if I only wanted the text from each message that was typed to this \"spolsky\" character?\n\nTo accomplish this in \"straight\" javascript I\'d be looking at writing a lot of loops and if/else code and then I would still have all these extra properties that I don\'t even need.\n\nJSOQ allows me to query a javascript object or collection of objects using a specified criteria and return only the properties/methods I want.\n\nSo lets go with the second option. Let\'s get all the .text members from all the messages that were sent to the \"spolsky\" user.\n\n<pre class=\"brush:javascript\">\nvar search_results = eval(our_json_result);\nvar result = null;\nwith(jsoq) {\n    result = From(search_results.results)\n                .query(\'text\')\n                .where(function(i) {\n                    return i.to_user === \"spolsky\";\n                });\n}\n</pre>\n\n \n\nAnd now our result object is filled with a bunch of other objects that would look something like:\n\n<pre class=\"brush:javascript\">\n{\n    text: \"@spolsky thats easy! http:\\/\\/tinyurl.com\\/2z42bs\"\n}\n</pre>\n\n \n\nPretty simple eh?

It\'s a twitter-like application that I started a while ago but due to <a href=\"\" title=\"Test Everything!\">my failure to test everything</a> I lost about 99% of my work and had to start over from scratch.\n\nBut this was sort of a good thing because it gave me a chance to revisit a lot of things that I wasn\'t very happy with the first time around. I just got done adding the ability for users to post new messages via AJAX.\n\nIn the first version of the application a user would type their status into a textbox, click submit and the page would refresh with their new message at the top of their user wall. Although functional this wasn\'t exactly very \"web 2.0\"-ish.\n\nMy controller will have an action called Index that takes two parameters, the message the users is posting and the tags associated with that message. m_UserService, and m_MessageService are private objects, that interact with the database.\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>\n[Authorize]\n[AcceptVerbs(HttpVerbs.Post)]\npublic ActionResult Index(string message, string[] tags)\n{\n\n	var messageOwner = this.m_UserService\n		.GetByUserName(User.Identity.Name);\n\n	var messageObj = new Message()\n	{\n		Owner = new User()\n		{\n			Identifier = messageOwner.Identifier,\n			UserName = messageOwner.UserName,\n			Email = messageOwner.Email,\n			RealName = messageOwner.RealName,\n			IsModerator = messageOwner.IsModerator\n		},\n		Body = message,\n		CreatedOn = DateTime.Now,\n		IsReply = message.StartsWith(\"@\")\n	};\n\n	this.m_MessageService.Post(messageObj);\n\n	return Json(messageObj);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\nThe JsonResult will be serialized/deserialized by the MVC framework when the code is run in a web project or IIS but I need to be able to test this as part of our build process.\n\n<i>* NOTE: For those of you who might be thinking \"how do we get around the authorization\"?

However, utilizing an extension method and the JavaScriptSerializer in System.Web.Script.Serialization we can come pretty close:\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>\n	Assert.AreEqual(\"some text\", jsonObject[\"someproperty\"]);\n</code></pre>\n\nHere is the code I used to achieve this (This code depends on <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/moq/\">Moq v3.0.108.5 which you can download here</a>):\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>\nusing System;\nusing System.Text;\nusing System.Web;\nusing System.Web.Script.Serialization;\nusing System.Web.Mvc;\n\nusing Moq;\n\npublic static class JsonResultExtensions\n{\n\n	public static T Deserialize&lt;T>(this JsonResult json,\n		Controller controller)\n	{\n\n		var jsonSB = new StringBuilder();\n\n		var httpResponseMock =\n			new Mock&lt;httpResponseBase>();\n\n		httpResponseMock.Setup(mock => {\n			mock.Write(It.IsAny&lt;string>());\n		}).Callback&lt;string>((s) => {\n			jsonSB.Append(s);\n		});\n\n		var httpContextMock = new Mock&lt;httpContextBase>();\n\n		httpContextMock.Setup(mock => mock.Response)\n			.Returns(httpResponseMock.Object);\n\n		controller.ControllerContext\n			.HttpContext = httpContextMock.Object;\n\n		jsonResult.ExecuteResult(\n			controller.ControllerContext);\n\n		return new JavaScriptSerializer()\n			.Deserialize&lt;T>(jsonSB.ToString());\n	}\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<strong>Update: Doh!

I love to write code. Most people do one thing for work and then another for their hobby. My girlfriend for instance works as an IT / Systems Engineer  and her other thing is photography.\n\n<em>My</em> other thing is writing <strong>more</strong> code. I never did this with any of my previous jobs (save dish washer... I did wash dishes when I was at home but I wasn\'t trying out new, cooler ways to wash them).\n\n... So where was I? Oh, right code junkie. So, I really like to write code and what I\'ve decided to do is start a new small project each week and try to use some new chunk of .Net or a new library and I\'ll post the end results of my efforts here for you all.\n\nAll of these projects will be offered under the CodeImpossible \"works on my machine\" code quality guarantee. But I\'ll never post something that flat-out doesn\'t work.\n\nSound good? Cool, let\'s kick it off - as the first entry into this space I\'d like to present <strong>TweetCommander</strong>.\n\nTweetCommander is a small .Net v3.5 console application that lies in wait, watching a twitter account for any new Direct Messages from another user (we\'ll call this person the \"owner\").\n\nWhen a direct message from the owner is found, TweetCommander will check to see if it contains certain text, and depending on that text, will perform a series of actions on the machine it is running on.\n\nTweetCommander will support three commands: \"current_screenshot\", \"exit\", and \"set_interval\".\n<ul>\n	<li>Sending \"current_screenshot\" will tell TweetCommander to take a screen capture of the Windows desktop, upload it to TwitPic, and then send the url for that image to the owner user in a Direct Message.</li>\n	<li>Sending \"exit\" will cause TweetCommander to exit</li>\n	<li>The \"set_interval\" is followed by a number that represents the number of seconds TweetCommander should wait between requests for new direct messages from twitter. This is more to avoid the API limit than anything else.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Settings</strong>\nTweetCommander will need to store the Twitter ID for the last successfully processed Direct Message somewhere so we aren\'t constantly processing the same commands over and over again. The end user won\'t need to be aware of this value but it\'s worth mentioning anyway.\n\nWe\'ll also need to store the wait interval so we don\'t lose this information if we need to restart TweetCommander for whatever reason.\n\nOkay, so here is the settings file I have so far:\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-348\" title=\"tweet_mon_console_settings\" src=\"http://wpup.codeimpossible.com/2009/04/tweet_mon_console_settings.jpg\" alt=\"tweet_mon_console_settings\" width=\"473\" height=\"170\" />\n\n<strong>Working with Twitter</strong>\nAll right so now we need to be able to interact with Twitter. Now, I don\'t want to write my own API library so I\'ll <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/tweetsharp\" target=\"_blank\">go out and get the latest copy of TweetSharp</a> which will give me a nice, readable interface to twitter\'s API. After getting this built I\'ll be able to get the most recent direct messages using the following code:\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>\nvar directMessages = FluentTwitter.CreateRequest()\n	.AuthenticateAs(\n		TWITTERACCOUNT_USERNAME,\n		TWITTERACCOUNT_PASSWORD)\n	.DirectMessages()\n	.Received()\n	.Since(Properties\n		.Settings\n		.Default\n		.LastProcessedCommandID)\n	.AsJson()\n	.Request()\n	.AsDirectMessages();\n</code></pre>\n\nThats pretty freakin\' sweet I must say. Tweet# really takes the brain work out of working with twitter and there is no way to look at that code and <strong>not</strong> understand what it is doing immediately. Epic win.\n\nTo get this running on your machine, just<a href=\"http://www.box.net/shared/hacsh3b3s4\" target=\"_blank\"> grab the source from my box.net folder</a>, and change these values at the top of the Program.cs file:\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>\n// this is our \"owner account\" we will only act upon direct messages\n// send from this user\nprivate static string TWITTEROWNER  = \"codeimpossible\"; \n\n// this is our listener accounts username\nprivate static string TWITTERACCOUNT_USERNAME = \"someuser\";\n\n// this is our listener accounts password\nprivate static string TWITTERACCOUNT_PASSWORD = \"somepassword\";\n</code></pre>\n\n<em>Note: The solution file for this contains a reference to a compiled version of  the Tweet# library that contains </em><a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/tweetsharp/issues/detail?id=36\"><em>a quick patch I made for an issue that affects uploading an image to Twitpic</em></a><em>.

If there is a free service that does something I need I will try my hardest to get that service into whatever I am working on. I\'m currently working on an Asp .Net MVC project that needs Avatars (you know, those funny little pictures next to peoples names on Twitter). Enter <a href=\"http://www.gravatar.com\">Gravatar</a>.\n<br />\nGravatar is an awesome service for anyone looking to add avatars to their apps. It\'s free, incredibly simple to implement, and removes a lot of the hassle around getting avatar support into your web/windows app.\n\nAdding Gravatar support to an application is pretty simple. Can you get a users email address? Can you MD5 said email address? Can you make an HTTP GET? BANG. You sir, or madam, can have Gravatars.\n\nThis week for the W.O.M.M. code sample I\'d like to show how I integrated gravatar support into an Asp .Net MVC application.\n\n<h3>How Gravatar Works In A Nutshell</h3>\nGravatar is a free service where you sign up and link images to one or more email addresses that you provide.\n\nOnce you link an image to an email address, any application that supports getting an image over the internet can show your Gravatar by making a request to a special URL. This URL is generated by combining an MD5 hash of your email address with some other parameters and the end result is a link to your Gravatar image.\n\nIE: the link to my Gravatar on the right of this page is:\n\n<code>\nhttp://www.gravatar.com/avatar/15559d868ec27b8583f42116a6b96c14?s=140\n</code>\n\nSo 15559d868ec27b8583f42116a6b96c14 is the hash of my email address - don\'t worry it\'s a one-way hash. The \"s\" parameter is the size of the image that I want, in this case 140 pixels.\n\nThat is pretty much it as far as how the system works, but if you want to read more, check out <a href=\"http://en.gravatar.com/site/implement\">Gravatar\'s implementation documentation</a>.\n\n<h3>The Goal</h3>\nWhat I wanted was an HtmlHelper extension method that I could use in my view pages to create an IMG tag with the correct Gravatar URL. After <a href=\"http://en.gravatar.com/site/implement/url\">looking at the documentation on Gravatars \"How the URL is constructed\" page</a>, I decided my helper extension should support the following:\n\n<b>Avatar Size (the \"s\" parameter)</b><br />\nWhen making a Gravatar URL you can specify a specific size for the Gravatar image. The size can be anything from 1 to 512 pixels, but the default is 80.\n\n<b>Default Avatars (the \"d\" parameter)</b><br />\nIf the email address you are using doesn\'t have any Gravatars setup, Gravatar will generate one for you by default. You can choose from 3 predefined Gravatar types or you can include a URL to a custom avatar of your own. The predefined Gravatar types are Identicon, Wavatar, and Monsterid.\n\n<b>Rating (the \"r\" parameter)</b><br />\nThis wasn\'t a requirement for what I was working on, but you can designate the maximum \"rating\" of the avatars that Gravatar will generate. The accepted values are \"g\", \"pg\", \"r\", and \"x\" and they are inclusive, so specifying \"r\" will allow \"g\" and \"pg\" rated Gravatars to be generated. Gravatars that are rated \"x\" will be returned as one of the predefined avatars above. The default rating is \"g\".\n\n<h3>The Code</h3>\nOkay, so now I know what I need to support. Now it\'s just a matter of getting the code to do this. Let\'s take a look at the class file I used to get this done.\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>\nnamespace System.Web.Mvc\n{\n using System;\n using System.Web.Routing;\n using System.Web.Security;\n\n public enum GravatarDefaultTypes\n {\n Identicon,\n Wavatar,\n Monsterid,\n Custom\n }\n\n public static class GravatarExtension\n {\n		public static string Gravatar(\n			this HtmlHelper hh,\n			string emailAddress,\n			int size,\n			GravatarDefaultTypes defaultType,\n			string customImageUrl,\n			RouteValueDictionary htmlAttributes)\n {\n var tagBuilder = new TagBuilder(\"img\");\n string url = \"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/{0}?d={1}&s={2}\";\n\n	 // thanks to jon galloway for this one-liner!\n // http://www.eggheadcafe.com/aspnet/how-to/141740/adding-gravatars-to-your.aspx\n string hash = FormsAuthentication\n				.HashPasswordForStoringInConfigFile(emailAddress, \"MD5\");\n string defImg = defaultType.ToString().ToLower();\n\n if (defaultType == GravatarDefaultTypes.Custom)\n {\n defImg = System.Web\n					.HttpUtility\n					.UrlEncode(customImageUrl);\n }\n\n url = String.Format(\n url,\n hash.ToLower(),\n defImg,\n size.ToString());\n\n tagBuilder.MergeAttributes(htmlAttributes);\n tagBuilder.MergeAttribute(\"src\", url);\n\n return tagBuilder.ToString(TagRenderMode.Normal);\n }\n }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\nSo you can see I\'m not storing the hash of the email address, instead I am going to pass in the unaltered string. I didn\'t want to have another piece of data to update when the user changed their email address so the Gravatar() method takes an email address and encodes it using a call to FormsAuthentication.HashPasswordForStoringInConfigFile(), which is awesome ( Thanks Jon, you rock!).\n\nAlso, I\'m not sure if this is a no-no or what, but I did put the extension class under the System.Web.Mvc namespace. This was mainly a convenience (read: laziness) thing and can be easily changed.\n\nAlright so we have some code now, let\'s take a look at how it can be used in our views.\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>\n &lt;%= Html.Gravatar(\n 	Model.Email, // the email address\n 	50, // size, in pixels of the avatar\n 	GravatarDefaultTypes.Identicon,\n 	null,\n 	new RouteValueDictionary(new {\n 		style = \"vertical-align: middle;\"\n 	})\n )%> <br />\n <b> &lt;%= Model.UserName %> </b>\n</code></pre>\n\nLet\'s see how that looks.\n\n<img src=\"http://wpup.codeimpossible.com/2009/04/user-avatar.png\" alt=\"user-avatar\" title=\"user-avatar\" width=\"84\" height=\"81\" class=\"size-full wp-image-378\" />\n\nBooyah, avatar support in 55 lines of code. As always, if I screwed up or there is a better way to do this, please let me know.', '2011-05-01 02:48:35', 0, '')[0m

I found the solution to that in <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/irenak/archive/2006/11/03/sysk-233-how-to-decrypt-an-asp-net-encrypted-data.aspx\">Irena Kennedy\'s blog post on \"How to Decrypt an ASP.NET Encrypted Data\"</a>:\n<blockquote>Please note, that the code below should not be used in production code!

Jeff was discussing how the stackoverflow team implemented their route mappings:\n\n<em>\nThose routes are... the way we implemented them are actually like decorators. Attributes on the methods. <cite>- Jeff Atwood (stackoverflow episode #54)</cite>\n</em>\n\nThis instantly piqued my interest and I completely zoned out for the rest of the podcast: caught up in working out the details of how I could do this for my own Asp.net MVC projects. \n\nComing up with the actual attribute code was easy; writing the code to set up all the Routes using only data defined in by the attribute was tricky.\n\nBeing new to attributes, and reflection in general, it took me a few hours until I had a very basic demo working. However, I was really starting to like where it was going.\n\n<p class=\"right side-note callout-green\">\nAs a side note: There are lot of \"helper\" classes and objects in the route attribute project (it feels cluttered to me) and the reason I did this was to make the code in AssemblyExtensions.GetRoutes() easier to read.\n</p>\n\nAfter a few nights of <a href=\"http://twitter.com/digitalBush/status/2121662803\" target=\"_blank\">Mtn Dew and convenience-store cherry-pie</a> I finished the rough code, tests and demo project (included in this blog post) and I was starting to realize that:\n\n<ol>\n	<li>Using the attributes is more declaritive and it feels cleaner</li>\n	<li>Having your route information right above your actions is incredibly useful</li>\n	<li>I had no more need to switch back and forth between your controller and the Global.asax.cs</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>How does it work?</h2>\nAll of the real work for the RouteAttribute is done in the AssemblyExtensions class. This class uses extension methods to augment the System.Reflection.Assembly class with two methods: GetControllers() and GetRoutes().\n\nGetRoutes is the only method that is used by other classes, I made GetControllers public for unit testing.\n\n<h3>GetRoutes()</h3>\nGetRoutes\' first order of business is to make a list of data that it will need to build out all the routes for the assembly it was passed. After thats done GetRoutes will loop through the collected route data, build up each route and add it to the dictionary that will eventually be returned.\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>\nnamespace CodeImpossible.Mvc.Routing\n{\n public static class AssemblyExtensions\n {\n\n public static BindingFlags ActionFlags = \n BindingFlags.Instance | \n BindingFlags.Public |\n BindingFlags.DeclaredOnly;\n\n public static IList&lt;ControllerMetaData&gt; GetControllers(this Assembly assembly)\n {\n var controllers = assembly.GetTypes().ToList().FindAll(type =>\n {\n var isValidController = type.IsClass &&\n type.IsPublic &&\n type.IsSubclassOf&lt;Controller&gt;();\n\n var hasValidActions = type.GetMethods(ActionFlags).ToList().Any(m =>\n {\n var valid = false;\n if (m.ReturnParameter != null && m.ReturnParameter.ParameterType == typeof(ActionResult))\n {\n valid = m.GetAttributesOfType&lt;RouteAttribute&gt;().Count > 0;\n }\n\n return valid;\n });\n\n return isValidController && hasValidActions;\n }).Select&lt;Type, ControllerMetaData&gt;((t) => new ControllerMetaData(t)).ToList();\n\n return controllers;\n }\n\n public static IDictionary&lt;string, Route&gt; GetRoutes(this Assembly assembly)\n {\n var Routes = new Dictionary&lt;string, Route&gt;();\n\n var data = (from c in assembly.GetControllers()\n from a in c.GetActions()\n from r in a.Data\n select new\n {\n ControllerName = c.Name, \n ActionName = a.Name, \n RouteData = r, \n RouteParams = a.Params\n }).ToList();\n\n foreach (var r in data)\n {\n var route = new Route(r.RouteData.RoutePath, new MvcRouteHandler());\n route.Constraints = new RouteValueDictionary();\n route.Defaults = new RouteValueDictionary(new { \n controller = r.ControllerName, \n action = r.ActionName \n });\n\n if (r.RouteData.RequireRouteParams && r.RouteParams.Count() == 0)\n {\n throw new MissingRouteParameterException(\"Unknown\", r.RouteData.RoutePath);\n }\n\n var missingParams = new List&lt;ParameterMetaData&gt;();\n\n if (r.RouteData.RequireRouteParams)\n {\n missingParams = (from p in r.RouteParams\n where r.RouteData.RoutePath.IndexOf(\"{\" + p.Name + \"}\") == -1\n select p).ToList();\n }\n\n if (missingParams.Count > 0)\n {\n var param = missingParams.First();\n throw new MissingRouteParameterException(param.Name, r.RouteData.RoutePath);\n }\n\n foreach (var param in r.RouteParams)\n {\n if (param.Data != null)\n {\n if (param.Data.DefaultValue != null)\n {\n route.Defaults.Add(param.Name, param.Data.DefaultValue);\n }\n\n if (param.Data.Constraint != null)\n {\n route.Constraints.Add(param.Name, param.Data.Constraint);\n }\n }\n }\n\n Routes.Add(r.RouteData.Name ?? r.RouteData.RoutePath, route);\n }\n\n return Routes;\n }\n }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>Getting the Routes into the RouteTable</h2>\nSlapping route attributes onto your classes and methods is all well and good but it doesn\'t mean anything unless we can get those routes into the RouteTable object easliy. Originally I had the code to add the routes looking something like\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>\nvar routes = Assembly.GetCurrentExecutingAssembly().GetRoutes();\n\nroutes.ForEach(r => RouteTable.Add(r));\n</code></pre>\n\nThis, although pretty easy, wasn\'t as readible as I wanted. So I added some extension methods to the RouteTable class:\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>\nRouteTable.Routes.IncludeRoutesFromAssembly();\n</code></pre>\n\nI think both of these are much clearer than doing:\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>\nRouteTable.Routes.MapRoute(\"Root\",\n \"\",\n new { controller = \"Test\", action = \"GetItem\", id = 1 });\n\nRouteTable.Routes.MapRoute(\"Search\",\n \"Search/{id}\",\n new { controller = \"Test\", action = \"Search\", id = 1 });\n//.. SNIP ...\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>Using the RouteAttribute and RouteParamAttribute</h2>\nIn the controller \"TestController\" below there are three actions: Index, FindByText, and GetItem. Using the RouteAttribute and RouteParamAttribute makes it pretty clear that the routes for FindByText and GetItem are the same but use different RouteContraints. \n\nSo a request for /Test/Search/Hello will go to FindByText while /Test/Search/1 will go to GetItem. Also notice how GetItem has a default value of 2 for the id argument.\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>\npublic class TestController : Controller\n{\n\n [Route(RoutePath = \"Test\")]\n public ActionResult Index()\n {\n\n return View();\n }\n\n [Route(RoutePath = \"Test/Search/{query}\")]\n public ActionResult FindByText(\n [RouteParam(Constraint=\"[a-zA-Z]{1,}\")]\n string query)\n {\n\n return View();\n }\n\n [Route(RoutePath = \"Test/Search/{id}\")]\n public virtual ActionResult GetItem(\n [RouteParam(Constraint=@\"\\d{1,}\", DefaultValue=2)]\n int id)\n {\n\n return View();\n }\n}</code></pre>\nThere is support for binding multiple routes to the same action; just add another Route attribute:\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>\n[Route(\"Products/Search/{id}\")]\n[Route(\"Products/{id}\")]\npublic ActionResult GetProductById(int id)\n{\n return View();\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>Downsides or things I haven\'t gotten to yet</h2>\nJust some gotchas that I think people might raise issue with.\n\n<strong>All of your controllers must inherit from the System.Web.Mvc.Controller class</strong>\nThis isn\'t really a big deal because if you are using Asp.net MVC then you really should inherit from the Controller class, but for those of you using FubuMVC or another MVC framework this should be easy to change.\n\n<strong>Attributes can be ugly</strong>\nI know a few people out there are against attributes but I think that this is a more than acceptable use because it made the code much easier to understand.\n\n<strong>Reflection can be slow</strong>\nHonestly, when I first started working on this demo I was sort of turned off by the use of Reflection myself. After weighing the possible performance loss against the gains in both readability and maintenance I decided this was definitely worth it. I haven\'t performance tested this code so, as always YMMV.\n\nAs always, if I screwed up or there is a better way to do this, please let me know in the comments.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.box.net/shared/1q4bq5scuz\" target=\"_blank\">Download the source code mentioned in this blog post.</a>', '2011-05-01 02:48:35', 0, '')[0m

I chose javascript simply because it was something I knew I could get running pretty quickly. \n\nNext I\'ll need some variables.

I\'ve got my start variable (dropping the 0 in favor of more readable code), my end counter, and my \"where-am-i\" variables: current, previous, temp and my sum variable.\n\nObviously we\'ll need some kind of loop. How about a while loop?\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>\nwhile( current <= end )\n{\n	\n}\n</code></pre>\n\nCool.

Problem 3 asks you to find the largest <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_factor\">prime factor</a> of the number 600,851,475,143.\n\nMy solution is pretty simple but it works:\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>\nvar getLargestPrimeFactor = function(num)\n{\n var factors = [];\n for ( var f = 2; f &lt; num; f++ )\n {\n if( num%f == 0 )\n {\n factors.push(f);\n num = num /f;\n }\n }\n factors.push(num);\n return factors[factors.length-1];\n};\n\nalert( getLargestPrimeFactor(600851475143));\n</code></pre>\n<a title=\"Try this code!\" href=\"http://beta.jsvudo.com/76cc38\" target=\"_blank\">Try this code!</a>\n\nYou may have noticed that there isn\'t a check for a factors <del>optimus</del> primeness anywhere in there.\n\nThats because the <code>getLargestPrimeFactor()</code> function is dividing the number by it\'s smallest factor, and the smallest factor for any number is always prime so when we run out of factors we\'ve got the largest prime factor. Yeah, that\'s pretth cool IMO.\n\nI read the discussion threads for problem 3 after I solved it and I was surprised that hardly anyone removed the prime checks from their code.\n\nSo, problem 3 is in the bag and I feel pretty good about coming up with the prime check optimization (or lack thereof).

I never wrote them down or tried to keep track of them once the conversation was over so this year I decided to post them publicly to give me that extra bit of motivation, and also I\'ll be able to check back here throughout the year and see how I\'m measuring up.\n\nThese are in no particular order.\n\n<strong>I need to grow more as a professional.</strong> Last year I went to my first conference (MSDEVCON) and it was a total blast. I met a lot of truly awesome and intelligent people and learned a billion things that I didn\'t know before.

Woe is I. Why can’t we all just get along?!? \n\nWell, we can’t stop people from including their favorite javascript libraries, but what we can do is prevent our code from suffering as a result. We’ll need a nice, big beefy, bodyguard to make sure our code isn’t messed with while it’s out clubbing with Prototype, Scriptaculous or even MooTools (who invited <em>him</em>??!?).\n\nHere’s what our bodyguard function will look like\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>\n( function($) {\n\n} ) ( jQuery );\n</code></pre>\n\nSo what this does is call our anonymous function and pass the <code>jQuery</code> object. This will scope ‘$’ to within our little function so we won’t step on anyone else’s toes (and they won’t bump into us while we’re on the dance floor and spill our drink everywhere). Okay, I think I\'ve taken the clubbing metaphor far enough.\n\nBasically this will allow our code to run and use the <code>$</code> shortcut for JQuery as if it were loaded without any of these other libraries on the page. \n\nHere is what the completed code would look like:\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>\n&lt;script src=\"http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.1/jquery.min.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;\n&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&lt;script src=\"http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/prototype/1.6.1.0/prototype.js\" type=\"text/javascript\">\n&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;script src=\"http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/scriptaculous/1.8.3/scriptaculous.js\" type=\"text/javascript\">\n&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&lt;script type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;\n( function($) {\n // we can now rely on $ within the safety of our “bodyguard” function\n $(document).ready( function() { alert(\"nyah nyah! I’m able to use \'$\'!!!!\"); } );\n} ) ( jQuery );\n\n//this will fail\n$(document).ready( function() { alert(\'fail?\'); } );\n&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\nI love using this simple self-calling anonymous function style when working with jQuery because it saves me from typing <code>jQuery()</code>, which really does look a lot more ugly than using the <code>$()</code> shortcut. It also protects my code from any scoping issues and lets the code function normally when <a href=\"http://docs.jquery.com/Core/jQuery.noConflict\">jQuery is put into no conflict mode</a>. \n\nMy opinion, if you\'re doing work in jQuery on sites that you don\'t control 100%, you should be using this method to protect your code and your clients.\n\n<strong>Updated: changed link for jquery to use 1.4.1 at the google CDN (tsk, tsk, tsk I was using the googlecode.com link)</strong>', '2011-05-01 02:48:36', 0, '')[0m

It\'s still in really early stages and I\'m not quite sure about it\'s actual usefulness but I\'m learning a lot about JavaScript and having a ton of fun along the way!\n\nJsoq deals with arrays a lot. About 95% of it\'s use cases involve either looping through, altering, or creating arrays. Having a ton of <code>for</code> loops in my code just seems so... not right. For loops have always seemed dirty to me. They just aren\'t elegant enough. \n\nHere is your normal, average, everyday <code>for</code> loop in Javascript.\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>\nvar array = \"1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10\".split(\',\');\n\nfor(var i = -1, l = array.length; ++i &lt; l;) {\n alert(array[i]);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\nThis works. It\'s reliable and gets the message across. But what if we needed to loop over an array and get all the items that matched a condition? Using a <code>for</code> loop the code could look something like:\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>\nvar array = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4 ];\nvar results = [];\nvar condition = function(i) { return i%2 == 0; };\n\nfor(var itt = -1, len = array.length; ++itt &lt; len;) {\n	if( condition(array[itt]) ) {\n		results.push(array[itt]);\n	}\n}\n</code></pre>\n\nThis does work, I\'ve written code like this many times before, and while <em>technically</em> there isn\'t anything wrong with it I think there is still room for improvement.\n\nJsoq is going to be handling arrays all over the place so the solution to this problem <em>needs</em> to be simple.\n\nHere\'s what I need:\n<ul>\n	<li>to loop over an entire collection and perform an action on each item.</li>\n	<li>If that action produces a result, the item is to be pushed into an array and returned to after the loop is done</li>.\n	<li>Also: it needs to be readable, someone else coming along should be able to determine what this thing is doing without too much difficulty. So I had my work cut out for me. </li>\n</ul>\n\nA few hours later I had a decent function that I could use to replace a lot of the <code>for</code> loops I had. After some more refactoring I was able to wipe them all out and replace them with calls to <code>enumerateOver()</code>. Here is the latest version from source control:\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>\nfunction enumerateOver(collection, work) {\n	var result = [], val = [];\n	\n	if (isArray(collection)) {\n		try {\n			for (var i = -1, l = collection.length; ++i < l;) {\n				result = work(collection[i], i);\n				if (typeof result !== \"undefined\" && result != null) {\n					val.push(result);\n				}\n			}\n		}catch (e) {\n			if (e != jsoq.$break) throw(e);\n		}\n		\n		if (val.length > 0) {\n			return val;\n		}\n	}else {\n		try {\n			val = work(collection, 0);\n		}\n		catch (e) {\n			if (e != jsoq.$break) throw(e);\n		}\n		if (typeof val !== \'undefined\') {\n			return val;\n		}\n	}\n	return result == null ? [] : result;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\nAnd here is the code to replace the <code>for</code> loops above, re-written to use <code>enumerateOver()</code>\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>\nvar results2 = enumerateOver(array, function(i, c) {\n return i%2 == 0;\n});\n</code></pre>\n\nSo by implmenting this function I was able to come up with a more readable, testable and streamlined codebase. Is this suitable for everyone? Definitely not, but I did it for a few reasons:\n\n<ol>\n	<li>Like I mentioned before. I\'ve never been at ease with <code>for</code> loops and being able to replace them all with calls to a single function was a huge win for me</li>\n	<li>The normal use-case didn\'t fit right. I needed to not only iterate over arrays but also return the results of work performed on those items. Doing this the \"regular\" way just wouldn\'t work (see previous reason)</li>\n	<li>I thought this was a fun problem to solve</li>\n</ol>\n\nIf you have any feedback, good, bad, or indifferent add a comment!', '2011-05-01 02:48:36', 0, '')[0m

It will save you eons of time and frustration.\n\nIf you are like me, however, and started porting your project over manually and are now knee deep in WTFBBQ sauce then follow the steps below and your project should be up and running in no time.\n\n1. Back up your project. Just in case.\n\n2. Open your project file(s) inside your favorite text editor (one with a decent find/replace system). Open the Find &amp; Replace dialog and find <code>\"603c0e0b-db56-11dc-be95-000d561079b0\"</code>, replacing it with <code>\"F85E285D-A4E0-4152-9332-AB1D724D3325\"</code>. My project turned up 1 result.\n\n3. Open the Web.Config files in the root of the project and the root of the /Views folder. Open the Find &amp; Replace dialog again, this time searching for <code>\"System.Web.Mvc, Version=1.0.0.0\"</code> and replacing it with <code>\"System.Web.Mvc, Version=2.0.0.0\"</code>.\n\n4. Add the following BindingRedirect to the bottom of the root Web.Config, just before the &lt;/Configuration&gt; node.\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>\n&lt;runtime&gt;\n &lt;assemblyBinding xmlns=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1\"&gt;\n &lt;dependentAssembly&gt;\n &lt;assemblyIdentity name=\"System.Web.Mvc\" publicKeyToken=\"31bf3856ad364e35\"/&gt;\n &lt;bindingRedirect oldVersion=\"1.0.0.0\" newVersion=\"2.0.0.0\"/&gt;\n &lt;/dependentAssembly&gt;\n &lt;/assemblyBinding&gt;\n&lt;/runtime&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n5. Open the solution in Visual Studio and replace the references to System.Web.Mvc 1.0 with the 2.0 assembly.\n6. Finally, and only if you really need them, open a new MVC 2.0 project and copy all the files in the /Scripts folder to your project. \n\nEnjoy your freshly migrated project!', '2011-05-01 02:48:36', 0, '')[0m

Too many years of not having something like powershell at my finger-tips.\n\nAfter about 10 minutes of fighting with batch language limitations <a href=\"http://twitter.com/codeimpossible/statuses/19095201324\">I decided to move on and try my hand at using powershell</a> to help automate the developer environment setup.\n\nSo I borrowed some code from Adam Weigerts blog to bypass the need for the gacutil (and the .Net Framework SDK, a whopping 100mb download!). Once I had this, I just had to come up with the code to recurse over all the .dll files that are stored in sub-folders within a \"Source Dependencies\" folder. \n\nFrom concept to finish I think this took me about an hour to come up with, I\'m no programming super soldier so anyone who is doing windows development should be able to throw together a powershell script to automate their common, repetitive and annoying tasks.\n\nThe code is included below, I\'ll be adding to it as the project goes on, pushing in some other environment setup features (dev db creation/sync would be the next feature for this).

I use AutoHotKey at both home and work to perform some simple (and some complex) text replacement macros. In this post I\'ll take you through a few simple examples of what AutoHotKey can do to show why I think this is an essential item for your developer batman utility belt.\n\nYou can download AutoHotKey from its website, <a href=\"http://www.autohotkey.com/download/\">here</a>.\n\n<strong>The really, really basic example - replacing text: </strong><br />\nHere is a sample script that I use to write out my work email address\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>\n:*:@work::jbarboza@wakefly.com\n</code></pre>\n\nIt looks a little confusing but trust me, it\'s really simple. The * tells AHK that this script is an \"instant replacement\" and AHK should not wait for the spacebar to be pressed. \"@work\" as you\'ve probably guessed is the trigger and \"jbarboza@wakefly.com\" is the replacement text. Note: AHK doesn\'t care about the @ symbol in <code>@work</code>, it\'s only there for consistency with my other email triggers.\n\n<strong>Another simple example - fixing common misspellings</strong><br />\nI suck at spelling. I make spelling mistakes <strong>all the time</strong>. These script lines show how I auto-correct a few of my more common spelling mistakes.\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>\n:*?:.cm::.com \n:*?:.ocm::.com\n</code></pre>\n\n<strong>AutoHotKey can also run applications:</strong><br />\nAHK isn\'t just for replacing text. The built-in scripting language can do a multitude of things, from manipulating selected text, gathering user input via prompts and using it in script output, even automate applications.\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>\n#f::Run Firefox\n</code></pre>\n\nThis script will run Firefox when you press [Windows Button] + f. The # symbol in AHK is a shortcut for the windows key. You can use other shortcuts like ^, and ! for CTRL and ALT respectively.\n\nThis is just a small sampling of what AHK can do, if you\'re interested in learning more about the AHK scripting language check out the <a href=\"http://www.autohotkey.com/docs/Hotkeys.htm\">HotKey Introduction in the AHK Documentation</a>, the <a href=\"http://lifehacker.com/tag/autohotkey/\">AHK articles on Lifehacker</a>, or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutoHotKey\">the AutoHotKey wikipedia page</a>.', '2011-05-01 02:48:36', 0, 'AutoHotKey is a free, open-source macro-creation app for Windows.

To understand the for/in loop we\'ll have to dive deeper into objects and arrays and how JavaScript <del datetime=\"2010-10-19T05:29:37+00:00\">mis</del>treats them.\n\n<strong>Objects in JavaScript</strong><br />\nIn most other programming languages these days, everything is an object. You can see this in current languages like C# where everything inherits from System.Object or in Ruby where you can assign properties and methods to anything at will.\n\nJavaScript is an object oriented language but it\'s implementation of objects is a little different from other languages. In JavaScript every object (every thing) is an array - a special array called an \"associative array\". If you\'re a C# developer think <code>Dictionary&lt;string, object&gt;</code>. If you\'re a python developer then you\'re already familiar with this concept. <br />\n<br />\nSo in JavaScript:\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>\nvar x = {\n something: \"hi\"\n};\n</code></pre>\nand\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>\nvar y = [];\ny[\"something\"] = \"hi\";\n</code></pre>\ndefine the same thing. Both objects will have a \"something\" property with the value \"hi\".\n\n<strong>Need more proof?</strong><br />\nTry the following:\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>\nalert( typeof( new Array() ) );\n</code></pre>\n\nThis will alert \"object\". Huh?\n\nYup, more proof that an array is just an object with properties named \"0\", \"1\", \"2\" etc. This means that\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>\nvar a = {\n 0: \"hi\",\n 1: \"there\"\n};\n</code></pre>\nand\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>\nvar b = [ \"hi\", \"there\" ];\n</code></pre>\nare the same exact thing. <a href=\"http://beta.jsvudo.com/3f40176\">Try it out!</a>\n\n\n<strong>Alright, that is insane but why the problem with for/in?</strong><br />\nWhen you use a for/in on an object in javascript you are looping over the keys in the key/value collection that makes up that object. So doing\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>\nvar x = {\n prop1: \"test\",\n prop2: \"test\"\n};\n\nfor(var p in x ) {\n alert(p);\n}\n</code></pre>\nwill alert \"prop1\" followed by \"prop2\". Using a for/in doesn\'t try to treat the object as an array, it enumerates each property (or key) in the object.\n\nNow you should start to see why for/in is generally a bad idea in JavaScript - that is, unless you <strong>want</strong> to loop over the properties of an object. \n\n<strong>Another fun fact</strong><br />\nThe for/in loop isn\'t guaranteed to alert \"prop1\" before \"prop2\". The properties will be enumerated in whatever order the interpreter returns them in.\n\nSo to summarize, unless you want to enumerate an objects properties, and you don\'t care about their order, avoid using the for/in loop in your JavaScript code.', '2011-05-01 02:48:37', 0, 'JavaScript has a lot of good parts and bad parts but the for/in loop seems to walk the grey area in between.

Having said that I\'ve run into one pretty strange problem with it.\n\nAnother developer noticed that there were a lot of eventlog entries on our build server for our projects w3wp process. After looking into it I found that whenever our CI server ran a build the w3wp.exe process would exit with a StackOverflowException. \n\nStrange.\n\nThis wasn\'t a big deal since it wasn\'t affecting the overall availability of the application, but it was annoying to the dev team. \n\nIn visual studio, every time a file is added or a build is done locally the worker-process is recycled which meant that everytime a build was done locally, or a file was added to the project, each dev got the wonderful \"Visual Studio Just In-Time Debugger\" dialog. Like I said, not a big issue, just very annoying.\n\nAfter a bit of googling I found that this is indeed an issue with MvcTurbine but it has a very easy fix: just add the following lines to the class that inherits from <code>TurbineApplication</code>:\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>\n protected override void ShutdownContext ()\n {\n CurrentContext = null;\n ServiceLocator = null;\n }\n</code></pre>\n\n<a href=\"http://lozanotek.com/blog/\">Javier Lozano</a> - the author of MvcTurbine, explains what\'s causing the problem:\n\n<blockquote>Since we register the SeviceLocator with itself and we call dispose, essentially it calls dispose on all the types that it has registered, including [itself]. So this causes a recursive loop of calls to ServiceLocator.Dispose... Essentially you\'re preventing the disposition of the ServiceLocator from [happening] since this piece gets called at App_Shutdown. The fix for v2.2 will not be this, instead it will be addressed at the ServiceLocator registration.</blockquote>\n\nHere are some links where you can <a href=\"http://mvcturbine.codeplex.com/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=219449\">see the original post with Javier\'s answer</a>, take a <a href=\"https://github.com/jglozano/mvcturbine/blob/master/src/Samples/SMExtensions/Mvc/StructureMapTurbineApplication.cs\">look at the code that Javier posted showing the fix in place</a>, and <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3344652/adding-removing-a-file-in-vs2010-causes-webdev-webserver20-exe-has-stopped-worki\">the StackOverflow question that should provide some more context</a>.', '2011-05-01 02:48:37', 0, 'I had an issue the other day with MvcTurbine where our application would throw a StackOverflowException whenever the worker process recycled.')[0m

I briefly glanced at the covers and saw some interesting things. The very first thing I noticed was that one issue had, on the cover, an image of the Master Chief from Halo3 with \"XNA: Ready for Prime Time?\" in a huge, bold font. The other front page bullets for that issue indicated that the issue focused intensely on XNA and game development. The second thing I noticed was that the other issue included a \"13-step Crash Course for Using LINQ\".\n\nI tried desperately to hide the drool that had started to form at the corners of my mouth as I said \"Sure, I think these might be alright\". So I stuffed them into my backpack like a theif with a fist full of unmarked bills and headed home. I just got done reading both issues and enjoyed their content, albeit one more than the other, so much that I felt compelled to note it here.\n\nI figure I would go over them in order of their publication (one covers July/August, the other September/October).\n\nJuly / August (vol. 8, issue 4)\nSadly this is the issue that I was least impressed with. Not because it was a \"horrible\" publication. it just didn\'t cover as many topics that interested me as the other issue. In fact it only covered one. Linq. Linq is Microsofts\' latest \"wow\" feature for .NET 3.5 (codename: \"Orcas\") and is quite possibly the coolest god damned thing I have ever seen but since this is just a review of a magazine I\'ll save my fanfare for LINQ for another day. The article, for those interested can be found <a href=\"http://www.code-magazine.com/Article.aspx?quickid=0707051\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\n\nSeptember / October (vol. 8, issue 5)\nThis issue had a lot to offer that interested me. There was a great write-up featuring <a href=\"http://www.code-magazine.com/Article.aspx?quickid=0709031\" target=\"_blank\">productivity tips SQL 2005</a> which I think every developer should read. Items of note: Pivot, Output Into, CTEs and Recursive Queries. Really, really cool stuff.\n\nThe next part was all about Microsofts\' XNA game development framework.

It\'s part and parcel of the whole office gig. It\'s easy to get caught up in the all the drama that is going on at work \"Did you hear that Josh and Tina are an item now?\", \"I heard we are all going to be working for Herbert next week!\", etc. We are all gossipers. Even those that seem impervious to the gossip will eventually find themselves caught up in it if they are not careful.<!--more-->\n\n<img src=\"http://www.ksl.com/emedia/slc/133/13352/1335293.jpg\" height=\"250\" width=\"250\" /> Basic tips for surviving the rumor mill are pretty simple and follow common sense pretty strictly. First off, just because rumors and gossip are generally more closely associated with women don\'t let this fool you. Men are just as guilty of gossip and in my own experiences just as bad or worse at getting caught up in the rumors flying around. Some people are more easily caught up when they hear something from Jon than if they had heard the same thing from Samantha. Don\'t let this fool you. When it comes to rumors trust no one.\n\nThe rumor mill has no age limit. People of any age can get wrapped up in the rumor mill. Don\'t trust the more experienced ad executive simply because he is older. That doesn\'t mean he has more experience than anyone else with the rumor mill.\n\nWhen you hear a rumor take it with a grain of salt. Remember that game you played in kindergarten where all the kids sat in a circle and one child whispered a phrase to their neighbor and that child whispered what they heard to their neighbor and so on and so on? Remember how the result was completely different than the phrase at the beginning? Well the rumor mill is simply this principle put into practice on a larger (or smaller) scale.\n\nDon\'t react. When someone presents you with a rumor that is particularly inflammatory resist the urge to react in the moment. Take a breath, dismiss yourself from the conversation, go for a walk, get some water or coffee do anything but react. If your team is going to be transferred to Herberts\' reign then it is going to happen. There is nothing you can do about it now the best thing that can be done is to try to establish a working relationship with Herbert or polish your resume.\n\nIt\'s easy to get caught up in the rumor mill but it is not impossible to avoid. Remember to take all rumors with a grain of salt, and to never react to a rumor in the moment and you will discover you have what it takes to survive the office rumor mill.', '2011-05-01 03:34:43', 0, '')[0m

I started pretty innocently enough. Both of us had a 4 day weekend coming up and we knew we wanted to get away from the area (family stress, house stress, apartment stress, work stress etc) and go someplace where we\'d never been and wouldn\'t know anyone.<!--more-->\n\nEarly rising (good morning at 4am!!), rush to the airport (hello Logan.), plane flight (horrible movie, \"waitress\" or some other nonsense. Ugh.)\n\nWhen we arrived at Phoenix airport we were absolutely starving. We were ready for a burger, some fries, onion rings, a side order of pizza anything we could get our hands on really. However, we completely forgot about the timezone change. Our bodies were saying that it was lunch time but everyone was still serving breakfast. Hungry, we left the terminal and vowed to get lunch ASAP on the way to our hotel.\n\n<img src=\"http://lh5.google.com/pistalwhipped/RykmfZvujMI/AAAAAAAAAkI/dn-wd9NzS3g/s288/DSC02155.JPG\" align=\"left\" height=\"216\" hspace=\"6\" vspace=\"4\" width=\"288\" />The commute was uneventful. We were completely awestruck by the landscape and I couldn\'t believe we seemed so far away from home. We were already starting to relax and forget all the crap we left at home. Except for the cats of course. I set up a web-cam before we left to upload pictures of the cats at intervals to the ftp server we have. The cats must have known about the camera because we were only able to spot <a href=\"http://wiki.pistalwhipped.net/pmwiki.php?n=Bios.Shiva\" target=\"_blank\">Shiva</a> on the next to last day of our trip.\n\nBack to the trip. We arrived at the Carefree Resort around noon-time and our first impression was that the name fit this place very well. We checked in, went to our villa and spent the rest of the day getting familiar with the surrounding area (and the couch).\n\nOn the second day we visited the Out of Africa zoo and got to see some really amazing animals up close. There was a great spotted leopard there that even though it only had three legs it could still completely ravage anyone of the visitors. That leopard was a complete bad-ass. It lost it\'s leg when it was a cub because it tried to smack a lion (yeah, a lion) that was in a cage next to it and the lion mangled it\'s limb so bad that it had to be removed.\n<p align=\"right\"><img src=\"http://lh5.google.com/pistalwhipped/RykmbZvujII/AAAAAAAAAjo/tJc_eaFvgQ4/s288/DSC02132.JPG\" align=\"right\" height=\"216\" hspace=\"4\" vspace=\"4\" width=\"288\" /></p>\nWe also saw a demonstration called \"Tiger Splash\" which was one of the most amazing things I\'ve seen. Zoo personnel running around with Bengal tigers trying to get the tigers to chase them around. The human performers would pretend to be wounded animals (walking on all fours, dragging a leg) and when the tigers would chase them they would run and jump into a 4 foot deep pool that was located in the center of the ring. It was spectacular!\n\nOn our third day we hiked up Pinnacle peak (about 2400 ft up) and took in the view. Another excellent day. The hike wasn\'t strenuous at all and we got to see some really amazing scenery along the way. It felt more like a park than a hiking trail, there were people jogging up the peak as well as entire families just hanging out at the rest areas.\n\nI am completely in love with the state of Arizona and everyone has asked me when we are moving out there. I don\'t know about living there but we are already planning our next visit.

Well, January 19, 2038 3:14:08 UTC to be precise. <!--more-->\"Why?\" You ask? Well Unix calculates time as the number of seconds since January 1, 1970 12:00:00. Each second is represented as an integer and the maximum value for a 32-bit integer is 2,147,483,647 which, when translated to seconds, equals 1/19/2038 3:14:07.\n\nThe author of the article above believes that 1 of two things will happen as a result of the failure. The software will either crash horribly or will simply roll back the date to 1/1/1970 at midnight. There isn\'t really a whole lot to worry about here though as by the year 2030 most operating systems will be in 64-bit land and probably even in 128-bit where the problem will be set to re-occur only 290 billion years in the future plus or minus a billion.

Why, oh why must we constantly include the runat=\"server\" attribute in our custom and pre-compiled web control declarations? To me it seems like this is unnecessary bloat that could be re-tooled to save developers more time and reduce headaches caused by forgetting it\'s inclusion.<!--more-->\n\nI\'m not asking for the runat=\"server\" attribute to be removed. Not at all. I\'m just stating that I think it was implemented in an inconvenient way and should be re-thought and re-designed. A blogger named <a href=\"http://www.mikeschinkel.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Mike Schinkel</a> posed <a href=\"http://www.mikeschinkel.com/blog/whyrunatserverforaspnet/\" target=\"_blank\">the same question</a> and a commenter replied:\n<blockquote>I understand your point, but the importance of [runat=\"server\"] is more for consistency and extensibility. If the developer has to mark some tags some ways (ie an \"asp:\" prefix) and in other cases using runat, then it creates more confusion. Also, this simplifies what is sent directly to the user agent as a Response.Write and what needs to be parsed by the ASP.NET engine. What if some user agent of the future has a name collision with one of the ASP.NET tags, it would be difficult otherwise to tell ASP.NET to ignore a tag.</blockquote>\n<strong>\"..is more for consistency and extensibility.\"</strong>\n<blockquote>\"Consistency is the last refuge of the unimaginative.\"\n- Oscar Wilde</blockquote>\nI\'m not sure why this person chose to argue consistency as one of his main points but it\'s a poor choice. He may as well have just said \"it is just done this way\". The runat attribute is required on all custom, pre-compiled or otherwise included web controls so why must it be specifically declared? Think about it in programming terms. If you have a literal string or integer littered throughout a class or function how likely would it be for you to replace that with a declared variable? I would do it 99% of the time.\n\n<strong>\"...this simplifies what...needs to be parsed by the ASP.NET engine.\"</strong>\n\nOkay, apparently they (Microsoft) have never heard of Regular Expressions? Why must we specifically tell the ASP.NET engine which controls are server controls when the work is already done via the Page\\Controls section of the web.Config when we include a control library? This seems overly redundant to me and reeks of poor implementation. The runat=\"server\" attribute is more like a legacy feature from 1.0 that for one reason or another (probably it\'s deep integration with the compiler and rendering engine) has not been removed yet.', '2011-05-01 03:34:43', 0, '')[0m

The main issues were that my \"Split post with More tag\" button was missing and the \"Code\" tab in the MCE no longer worked. I fixed both of these issues by performing the following edits:\n\n<!--more-->\n\n1. look for a line that equals:\n<blockquote>&lt;?php\n$my_drafts = get_users_drafts($user_ID);</blockquote>\n2.

When I saved a draft and later brought it up for editing my previous problems reared their ugly heads once again. This is due to wordpress using different pages for editing drafts and starting a new article, which seems like an odd choice to me. Why wouldn\'t you save these kinds of hassles by using one page to handle both requests? Okay, I\'m starting to ramble, back to the problem.\n\nIn order to fix the same problems I was having in my post-new.php file in the post.php file the edits are essentially the same (one additional new line must be added) they just occur in different areas.\n\n1. In the post.php file locate the line that reads:\n<blockquote>case \'edit\':</blockquote>\n2. After that line locate a line that reads:\n<blockquote>wp_enqueue_script(\'prototype\');</blockquote>\n3. just after that line paste:\n<blockquote>wp_enqueue_script(\'interface\');</blockquote>\n4. after the line you just pasted locate a line that looks like:\n<blockquote>require_once(\'admin-header.php\');</blockquote>\n5. paste the following code after the line above:\n<blockquote>?&gt;\n&lt;script src=\"&lt;?php echo get_option(\'siteurl\') ?&gt;/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/editor_plugin.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;?php</blockquote>\nNow save the files and upload them to your wp-admin directory and you should now be able to edit via the MCE problem free. I am not sure why these edits must be made and also why this isn\'t something that others have had to encounter as well.

The main feature that drew me to the open source browser was the that it supported user-generated plugins. I downloaded FF and stumbleupon and I was hooked. Since then I\'ve tried dozens of plugins and some have made me wonder how I used the internet before they came along (like stumbleupon and googlepedia) while some have made me wonder simply \"why?\".\n\n<!--more-->\n\nThe list below is comprised of the former type of plugin. These are the plugins that I could not imagine getting through my day-to-day routine without.\n\n1. StumbleUpon (<a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/138\" target=\"_blank\">download</a>)\nI honestly cannot remember which site or person turned me on to SU but whomever did is evil. SU is the most addictive experience I have been a part of since World of Warcraft. It is the perfect marriage of user generated content within an online community and it symbolizes Web 2.0 perfectly.\n\n2. Google Reader Notifier (<a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3977\" target=\"_blank\">download</a>)\nThe premise for this plugin is simple. If you have a Google Reader account this plugin will scan your incoming articles and alert you to how many you have and in what folder they are stored.\n\n3. GooglePedia (<a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2517\" target=\"_blank\">download</a>)\nI\'m not sure why this plugin isn\'t offered by Google. It will take your google search query and run it against Wikipedia and embed the most relevant article into the search results page. This plugin can slow down the loading of the results page (but it can be disabled easily by clicking the \'hide googlepedia link\').\n\n4. Morning Coffee (<a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2677\" target=\"_blank\">download</a>)\nFor me this plugin is more like after dinner cocktail. I use this plugin more at night to catch up on google reader, twitter, the blog, gmail and other websites without having to remember them.\n\n5. CustomizeGoogle &amp; GooglePreview (<a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/743\" target=\"_blank\">download</a>) &amp; (<a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/189\" target=\"_blank\">download</a>)\nI probably should have included all the google-based plugins together but oh well. CustomizeGoogle is perfect at removing unwanted ads from the search results page while GooglePreview does an excellent job at showing me the page I am about to navigate to beforehand.\n\n6. FoxyTunes (<a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/219\" target=\"_blank\">download</a>)\nWhat can I say, this plugin will handle Windows Media Player and iTunes but it will also handle more obscure media sources like Pandora, MusikCube, Las.fm and even Xbox Media Center. Plus it will embed your \"currently listening to\" in your blog or forum posts.\n\n7. Download Statusbar (<a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/26\" target=\"_blank\">download</a>)\nWhen I downloaded Firefox I was very happy that it eliminated the annoying download status window that plagues IE to this very day. But I eventually grew tired of having to hide and show this window to check on long downloads. Enter the Download Statusbar plugin. This baby creates a small, unobtrusive taskbar within FF that displays your current (and past) downloads. It will even color-code them by download speed!\n\n8. Firebug (<a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1843\" target=\"_blank\">download</a>)\nEvery web developer needs this plugin. I wish with every ounce of my soul that IE had a plugin like this. Firebug has solved many a javascript/css/html nightmare for me (even those I encountered only in IE). This plugin can cause some sites to run slowly but it can be disabled very easily.', '2011-05-01 03:34:43', 0, '')[0m

Instead I\'d like to talk about the changes that I am most excited about.\n<h3><strong>Galleries</strong></h3>\nI\'ve set up photo galleries on many platforms, PhpNuke, Nucleus CMS, WP, Greymatter and MovableType to name a few. Out of all of those, I had the least trouble with wordpress. However I still had to download a plugin that wasn\'t supported by wordpress and I wasn\'t sure if it would be around after six months.\n\nThe gallery function in WP 2.5 is excellent. My only gripe is that it seems to take a while for my uploaded pictures to show up in the gallery tab but I assume this is just due to excessive load on the server.\n<h3>Writing</h3>\nThe new editor is excellent. I am very happy with the full-screen mode. It allows me to focus on what I am typing which makes editing and reviewing that much easier. When not in fullscreen mode the UI of the writing page is just like the rest of wordpress. It just feels right.\n<h3>Speed</h3>\nWordpress 2.5 <em>feels</em> faster. I\'d have to have my old 2.3.3 version of WP back to do a comparison (please no!) but 2.5 just feels faster to me. All the pages respond snappily and posting doesn\'t take as long as it used to.\n\nThe WP team has definitely set the bar for all other blog platforms and they\'ve set it pretty damn high. <a title=\"Katz Web Design Review of WordPress 2.5\" href=\"http://katzwebdesign.wordpress.com/2008/04/04/wordpress-dot-com-finally-updates-to-2-point-5-a-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Katz Web Design</a> asked \"<em>who would want to use Blogger.com?</em>\" and I think that is the perfect question.

Lets break it out into segments for easier reading.\n<pre>0 [0x01] \n1 [05] \n2 [000000000005] \n3 [15000000] \n4 [F2EBB914] \n5 [9329116C] \n6 [5E352836] \n7 [0E040000]</pre>\nSegments 0 through 2 are used by Windows to validate the SID. 0 is the version number of the SID; currently, all Windows operating systems use \"1\" as the version. 1 tells us that there are 7 segments in this SID (number of dashes minus 2). Segment 2 states that this sid has a top level authority of 5 which equals <strong>SECURITY_NT_AUTHORITY</strong>. (for a better description of what each security authority does please see <a title=\"Well-known SIDs\" href=\"http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa379649(VS.85).aspx\" target=\"_blank\">this KB article</a>)\n\nSegments 3 through 6 are little-endian 32-bit integers that describe the issuer of the SID. 7 is a 32-bit little-endian integer called the \"Relative ID\". This value is the id of the user on the machine that issued the SID. It is important to remember that these values are stored as little-endians because this will factor in when we translate them into the final SID.\n\nthe first part of the sid is the easiest to translate. In our example sid above the first 3 segments become \"S-1-5\" because every sid is prefixed with \"S\" and we drop segment 3 as it is only used in validation. The next part is where we translate the machine id and user id and this can be confusing when done for the first time. Since the values are stored in little-endian format we have to reverse the order of the bits so:\n<ul>\n	<li><strong>15000000 </strong>becomes 00000015 which translates to (hex to dec) 21</li>\n	<li><strong>F2EBB914 </strong>becomes 14b9eb2f which translates (hex to dec) to 347728882</li>\n	<li><strong>9329116C</strong> becomes 6c112993 which translates (hex to dec) to 1813064083</li>\n	<li><strong>5E352836</strong> becomes 3628355E which translates (hex to dec) to 908604766</li>\n</ul>\nNow we have our machine identifier and our SID is now\n<pre>S-1-5-21-347728882-1813064083-908604766</pre>\nAll we have to do now is translate the user id which follows the same process as the machine id so:\n<ul>\n	<li><strong>0E040000</strong> becomes 0000040e which translates (hex to dec) to 1038</li>\n</ul>\nSo we are all done and our final sid is:\n<pre>S-1-5-21-347728882-1813064083-908604766-1038</pre>', '2011-05-01 03:34:43', 0, '')[0m

It\'s sort of scary being a noob in real life. There is a lot to learn: the culture, what to say, what to do and most importantly what not to say and what not to do.\n\nThe hardest lesson I\'ve had to learn is to not be afraid of the words \"<em>I don\'t know</em>\". I used to assume I knew the answer to everything or that I was expected to know the answer. I was wrong. Nobody has all the answers and those people that seem to either A) are being asked the right questions or B) are making it up.\n\nIt\'s hard looking your boss in the face and saying that you don\'t know the answer to whatever he/she is asking you but it\'s even harder to say it later or worse: when he/she finds out on their own.\n\nAnother thing I\'ve learned that you never say \"yes\" under pressure. Ever. If someone comes to you to ask you for something and you are occupied or in a rush then simply say so. Say \"I\'m really busy right now, give me some time to come up with an accurate assessment\".\n\nIf the person needed the estimate 5 minutes ago then qualify your response: \"I\'ll need more time to get you an accurate assessment but my best guess right now would be...\". This can really save you some stress further down the line.\n\nAlso, Read. Read everything. Read blogs, MSDN Articles, newsgroups, magazines (\"Code\" is pretty good) and most importantly books.

Although he has not gotten any better he does plan to work on another file manager when his health improves.\n\nHis article is a must-read for anyone that used Xtree and a strongly suggested read for anyone that develops software professionaly.

I was uploading about 10gb of ISO images to our file server at home and I started to notice a lot of dialog boxes appearing in my RDP window (the server is a headless box).\n\nThe messages were saying that Windows couldn\'t read XXXX file because the file or folder was corrupt.\n\nI waited for my transfers to finish and tried to run chkdsk. No luck. Chkdsk couldn\'t initialize on the drive in question. Uh oh. I rebooted and crossed my fingers.\n\nAfter a while the server came back online and I went back in over RDP. I immediately noticed that 80gb of data had been cleared from the drive! Now I was starting to panic. The 80gb of data included almost everything we use including:\n\n \n<ul>\n	<li>Software Downloads</li>\n	<li>Our in-house SVN Repository</li>\n	<li>Code files from years past (not in SVN)</li>\n	<li>All of our Music</li>\n	<li>All of our Pictures</li>\n	<li>Various Documents (tax documents, important medical stuff etc)</li>\n</ul>\n \n\n<span> </span>\n\nBasically everything you wouldn\'t want to lose right? \n\n<em>\"No problem\"</em>, I thought. I\'ve been meaning to wipe this machine and get back to a fresh install for a while. So I reformatted the main drive and began re-installing Windows.\n\nWhile this was going on I downloaded our backups from Mozy Home, retrieving our documents, pictures, music, everything. Or so I thought.\n\nAfter Windows was done I started by re-creating all the shares on the cleared drive. I began installing SVN from scratch, setting up our repositories again and getting ready to re-check-in my code from my main pc.\n\nDuring this process I started moving directories around on my main pc and got confused about what folders had what in them and I eventually ended up deleting all the code on that machine in one key stroke. I immediately knew what I had done but I kept my cool.\n\n<em>\"It\'s still cool. I have the backups. I\'ll be a day behind but I\'ll have my code\"</em>.\n\nSo I restore the backup from the Mozy download and start browsing the repository from my main pc. One problem though, I\'m not seeing any code newer than 12/07/2008. This can\'t be. I wrote a nightly backup script!\n\nAfter checking the script I realized my problem. Yes, I had written the backup script to run nightly and yes, it was running every night but it wasn\'t overwriting the old backup data because the files were protected. \n\nNow at this point I am beyond devastated. I\'ve just committed the cardinal sin in computers. I assumed my backups would work and never fully tested them. I am, for lack of a better term, completely screwed.\n\nSince then I\'ve run a whole slew of data recovery tools on both machines with no luck. My data is gone. A good month and a half of up-till-4am coding sessions completely gone.\n\nTest all the time and test everything. Don\'t just assume things will work because they most likely won\'t when you need them the most.\n\n \n\nUpdate: I thought this was really pretty funny: <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/84556/whats-your-favorite-programmer-cartoon/110481#110481\">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/84556/whats-your-favorite-programmer-cartoon/110481#110481</a>', '2011-05-01 03:34:44', 0, '')[0m

Some things have changed since then and I\'ve tried to keep the post up-to-date. Enjoy!</em>\n\n<em>Also, another similar library has come out recently: <a href=\"http://www.codeplex.com/jsinq\" target=\"_blank\">JSINQ</a> which is a really feature-rich LINQ to Object implementation in Javascript. Really bad-ass stuff.</em></blockquote>\nThe Elevator Pitch:\n\nJSOQ is an open-source pet project of mine that lets you easily access the data that you need from large collections in JavaScript. It was developed over a two week period in September of 2008 and is currently at version 1.1.\n\nEveryone probably just shrugged and said \"so??\" Well let me show you. \n\nLets assume that you have the following JSON string from another web application like, say <a title=\"Twitter search results in JSON\" href=\"http://search.twitter.com/search.json?q=codeimpossible\" target=\"_blank\">twitter search results</a> for example:\n\n<pre class=\"brush:javascript\">\n{\"results\":[\n{\n\"text\":\"Just another day at the office\",\n\"to_user_id\":null,\n\"from_user\":\"codeimpossible\",\n\"id\":1194587890,\n\"from_user_id\":1316793,\n\"iso_language_code\":\"en\",\n\"profile_image_url\":\"www.path.to.image.us\",\n\"created_at\":\"Tue, 10 Feb 2009 05:47:33 +0000\"\n},\n{\n\"text\":\"@spolsky thats easy! http:\\/\\/tinyurl.com\\/2z42bs\",\n\"to_user_id\":1357501,\n\"to_user\":\"spolsky\",\n\"from_user\":\"codeimpossible\",\n\"id\":1194582705,\n\"from_user_id\":1316793,\n\"iso_language_code\":\"en\",\n\"profile_image_url\":\"www.path.to.image.us\",\n\"created_at\":\"Tue, 10 Feb 2009 05:44:51 +0000\"\n}\n]} \n</pre>\n\nIn the sample above we only have two results but JSOQ has been tested to work with collections of tens of thousands of items.\n\nThe JSON object we have here is perfectly fine if we watned to show a whole bunch of data to the end user, but what if I only wanted to show the search results after a certain date? Or what if I only wanted the text from each message that was typed to this \"spolsky\" character?\n\nTo accomplish this in \"straight\" javascript I\'d be looking at writing a lot of loops and if/else code and then I would still have all these extra properties that I don\'t even need.\n\nJSOQ allows me to query a javascript object or collection of objects using a specified criteria and return only the properties/methods I want.\n\nSo lets go with the second option. Let\'s get all the .text members from all the messages that were sent to the \"spolsky\" user.\n\n<pre class=\"brush:javascript\">\nvar search_results = eval(our_json_result);\nvar result = null;\nwith(jsoq) {\n    result = From(search_results.results)\n                .query(\'text\')\n                .where(function(i) {\n                    return i.to_user === \"spolsky\";\n                });\n}\n</pre>\n\n \n\nAnd now our result object is filled with a bunch of other objects that would look something like:\n\n<pre class=\"brush:javascript\">\n{\n    text: \"@spolsky thats easy! http:\\/\\/tinyurl.com\\/2z42bs\"\n}\n</pre>\n\n \n\nPretty simple eh?

It\'s a twitter-like application that I started a while ago but due to <a href=\"\" title=\"Test Everything!\">my failure to test everything</a> I lost about 99% of my work and had to start over from scratch.\n\nBut this was sort of a good thing because it gave me a chance to revisit a lot of things that I wasn\'t very happy with the first time around. I just got done adding the ability for users to post new messages via AJAX.\n\nIn the first version of the application a user would type their status into a textbox, click submit and the page would refresh with their new message at the top of their user wall. Although functional this wasn\'t exactly very \"web 2.0\"-ish.\n\nMy controller will have an action called Index that takes two parameters, the message the users is posting and the tags associated with that message. m_UserService, and m_MessageService are private objects, that interact with the database.\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>\n[Authorize]\n[AcceptVerbs(HttpVerbs.Post)]\npublic ActionResult Index(string message, string[] tags)\n{\n\n	var messageOwner = this.m_UserService\n		.GetByUserName(User.Identity.Name);\n\n	var messageObj = new Message()\n	{\n		Owner = new User()\n		{\n			Identifier = messageOwner.Identifier,\n			UserName = messageOwner.UserName,\n			Email = messageOwner.Email,\n			RealName = messageOwner.RealName,\n			IsModerator = messageOwner.IsModerator\n		},\n		Body = message,\n		CreatedOn = DateTime.Now,\n		IsReply = message.StartsWith(\"@\")\n	};\n\n	this.m_MessageService.Post(messageObj);\n\n	return Json(messageObj);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\nThe JsonResult will be serialized/deserialized by the MVC framework when the code is run in a web project or IIS but I need to be able to test this as part of our build process.\n\n<i>* NOTE: For those of you who might be thinking \"how do we get around the authorization\"? I\'ll answer that in a later post (or you can <a href=\"http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ASPNETMVCSessionAtMix08TDDAndMvcMockHelpers.aspx\">check out Scott Hanselmans blog for the solution</a>).</i>\n\nIdeally I wanted to do something like the following in my test:\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>\n	Assert.AreEqual(\"some text\", jsonObject.someproperty);\n</code></pre>\n\nBut since C# is a type-safe language this isn\'t easily doable. However, utilizing an extension method and the JavaScriptSerializer in System.Web.Script.Serialization we can come pretty close:\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>\n	Assert.AreEqual(\"some text\", jsonObject[\"someproperty\"]);\n</code></pre>\n\nHere is the code I used to achieve this (This code depends on <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/moq/\">Moq v3.0.108.5 which you can download here</a>):\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>\nusing System;\nusing System.Text;\nusing System.Web;\nusing System.Web.Script.Serialization;\nusing System.Web.Mvc;\n\nusing Moq;\n\npublic static class JsonResultExtensions\n{\n\n	public static T Deserialize&lt;T>(this JsonResult json,\n		Controller controller)\n	{\n\n		var jsonSB = new StringBuilder();\n\n		var httpResponseMock =\n			new Mock&lt;httpResponseBase>();\n\n		httpResponseMock.Setup(mock => {\n			mock.Write(It.IsAny&lt;string>());\n		}).Callback&lt;string>((s) => {\n			jsonSB.Append(s);\n		});\n\n		var httpContextMock = new Mock&lt;httpContextBase>();\n\n		httpContextMock.Setup(mock => mock.Response)\n			.Returns(httpResponseMock.Object);\n\n		controller.ControllerContext\n			.HttpContext = httpContextMock.Object;\n\n		jsonResult.ExecuteResult(\n			controller.ControllerContext);\n\n		return new JavaScriptSerializer()\n			.Deserialize&lt;T>(jsonSB.ToString());\n	}\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<strong>Update: Doh!

I love to write code. Most people do one thing for work and then another for their hobby. My girlfriend for instance works as an IT / Systems Engineer  and her other thing is photography.\n\n<em>My</em> other thing is writing <strong>more</strong> code. I never did this with any of my previous jobs (save dish washer... I did wash dishes when I was at home but I wasn\'t trying out new, cooler ways to wash them).\n\n... So where was I? Oh, right code junkie. So, I really like to write code and what I\'ve decided to do is start a new small project each week and try to use some new chunk of .Net or a new library and I\'ll post the end results of my efforts here for you all.\n\nAll of these projects will be offered under the CodeImpossible \"works on my machine\" code quality guarantee. But I\'ll never post something that flat-out doesn\'t work.\n\nSound good? Cool, let\'s kick it off - as the first entry into this space I\'d like to present <strong>TweetCommander</strong>.\n\nTweetCommander is a small .Net v3.5 console application that lies in wait, watching a twitter account for any new Direct Messages from another user (we\'ll call this person the \"owner\").\n\nWhen a direct message from the owner is found, TweetCommander will check to see if it contains certain text, and depending on that text, will perform a series of actions on the machine it is running on.\n\nTweetCommander will support three commands: \"current_screenshot\", \"exit\", and \"set_interval\".\n<ul>\n	<li>Sending \"current_screenshot\" will tell TweetCommander to take a screen capture of the Windows desktop, upload it to TwitPic, and then send the url for that image to the owner user in a Direct Message.</li>\n	<li>Sending \"exit\" will cause TweetCommander to exit</li>\n	<li>The \"set_interval\" is followed by a number that represents the number of seconds TweetCommander should wait between requests for new direct messages from twitter. This is more to avoid the API limit than anything else.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Settings</strong>\nTweetCommander will need to store the Twitter ID for the last successfully processed Direct Message somewhere so we aren\'t constantly processing the same commands over and over again. The end user won\'t need to be aware of this value but it\'s worth mentioning anyway.\n\nWe\'ll also need to store the wait interval so we don\'t lose this information if we need to restart TweetCommander for whatever reason.\n\nOkay, so here is the settings file I have so far:\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-348\" title=\"tweet_mon_console_settings\" src=\"http://wpup.codeimpossible.com/2009/04/tweet_mon_console_settings.jpg\" alt=\"tweet_mon_console_settings\" width=\"473\" height=\"170\" />\n\n<strong>Working with Twitter</strong>\nAll right so now we need to be able to interact with Twitter. Now, I don\'t want to write my own API library so I\'ll <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/tweetsharp\" target=\"_blank\">go out and get the latest copy of TweetSharp</a> which will give me a nice, readable interface to twitter\'s API. After getting this built I\'ll be able to get the most recent direct messages using the following code:\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>\nvar directMessages = FluentTwitter.CreateRequest()\n	.AuthenticateAs(\n		TWITTERACCOUNT_USERNAME,\n		TWITTERACCOUNT_PASSWORD)\n	.DirectMessages()\n	.Received()\n	.Since(Properties\n		.Settings\n		.Default\n		.LastProcessedCommandID)\n	.AsJson()\n	.Request()\n	.AsDirectMessages();\n</code></pre>\n\nThats pretty freakin\' sweet I must say. Tweet# really takes the brain work out of working with twitter and there is no way to look at that code and <strong>not</strong> understand what it is doing immediately. Epic win.\n\nTo get this running on your machine, just<a href=\"http://www.box.net/shared/hacsh3b3s4\" target=\"_blank\"> grab the source from my box.net folder</a>, and change these values at the top of the Program.cs file:\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>\n// this is our \"owner account\" we will only act upon direct messages\n// send from this user\nprivate static string TWITTEROWNER  = \"codeimpossible\"; \n\n// this is our listener accounts username\nprivate static string TWITTERACCOUNT_USERNAME = \"someuser\";\n\n// this is our listener accounts password\nprivate static string TWITTERACCOUNT_PASSWORD = \"somepassword\";\n</code></pre>\n\n<em>Note: The solution file for this contains a reference to a compiled version of  the Tweet# library that contains </em><a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/tweetsharp/issues/detail?id=36\"><em>a quick patch I made for an issue that affects uploading an image to Twitpic</em></a><em>.

If there is a free service that does something I need I will try my hardest to get that service into whatever I am working on. I\'m currently working on an Asp .Net MVC project that needs Avatars (you know, those funny little pictures next to peoples names on Twitter). Enter <a href=\"http://www.gravatar.com\">Gravatar</a>.\n<br />\nGravatar is an awesome service for anyone looking to add avatars to their apps. It\'s free, incredibly simple to implement, and removes a lot of the hassle around getting avatar support into your web/windows app.\n\nAdding Gravatar support to an application is pretty simple. Can you get a users email address? Can you MD5 said email address? Can you make an HTTP GET? BANG. You sir, or madam, can have Gravatars.\n\nThis week for the W.O.M.M. code sample I\'d like to show how I integrated gravatar support into an Asp .Net MVC application.\n\n<h3>How Gravatar Works In A Nutshell</h3>\nGravatar is a free service where you sign up and link images to one or more email addresses that you provide.\n\nOnce you link an image to an email address, any application that supports getting an image over the internet can show your Gravatar by making a request to a special URL. This URL is generated by combining an MD5 hash of your email address with some other parameters and the end result is a link to your Gravatar image.\n\nIE: the link to my Gravatar on the right of this page is:\n\n<code>\nhttp://www.gravatar.com/avatar/15559d868ec27b8583f42116a6b96c14?s=140\n</code>\n\nSo 15559d868ec27b8583f42116a6b96c14 is the hash of my email address - don\'t worry it\'s a one-way hash. The \"s\" parameter is the size of the image that I want, in this case 140 pixels.\n\nThat is pretty much it as far as how the system works, but if you want to read more, check out <a href=\"http://en.gravatar.com/site/implement\">Gravatar\'s implementation documentation</a>.\n\n<h3>The Goal</h3>\nWhat I wanted was an HtmlHelper extension method that I could use in my view pages to create an IMG tag with the correct Gravatar URL. After <a href=\"http://en.gravatar.com/site/implement/url\">looking at the documentation on Gravatars \"How the URL is constructed\" page</a>, I decided my helper extension should support the following:\n\n<b>Avatar Size (the \"s\" parameter)</b><br />\nWhen making a Gravatar URL you can specify a specific size for the Gravatar image. The size can be anything from 1 to 512 pixels, but the default is 80.\n\n<b>Default Avatars (the \"d\" parameter)</b><br />\nIf the email address you are using doesn\'t have any Gravatars setup, Gravatar will generate one for you by default. You can choose from 3 predefined Gravatar types or you can include a URL to a custom avatar of your own. The predefined Gravatar types are Identicon, Wavatar, and Monsterid.\n\n<b>Rating (the \"r\" parameter)</b><br />\nThis wasn\'t a requirement for what I was working on, but you can designate the maximum \"rating\" of the avatars that Gravatar will generate. The accepted values are \"g\", \"pg\", \"r\", and \"x\" and they are inclusive, so specifying \"r\" will allow \"g\" and \"pg\" rated Gravatars to be generated. Gravatars that are rated \"x\" will be returned as one of the predefined avatars above. The default rating is \"g\".\n\n<h3>The Code</h3>\nOkay, so now I know what I need to support. Now it\'s just a matter of getting the code to do this. Let\'s take a look at the class file I used to get this done.\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>\nnamespace System.Web.Mvc\n{\n using System;\n using System.Web.Routing;\n using System.Web.Security;\n\n public enum GravatarDefaultTypes\n {\n Identicon,\n Wavatar,\n Monsterid,\n Custom\n }\n\n public static class GravatarExtension\n {\n		public static string Gravatar(\n			this HtmlHelper hh,\n			string emailAddress,\n			int size,\n			GravatarDefaultTypes defaultType,\n			string customImageUrl,\n			RouteValueDictionary htmlAttributes)\n {\n var tagBuilder = new TagBuilder(\"img\");\n string url = \"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/{0}?d={1}&s={2}\";\n\n	 // thanks to jon galloway for this one-liner!\n // http://www.eggheadcafe.com/aspnet/how-to/141740/adding-gravatars-to-your.aspx\n string hash = FormsAuthentication\n				.HashPasswordForStoringInConfigFile(emailAddress, \"MD5\");\n string defImg = defaultType.ToString().ToLower();\n\n if (defaultType == GravatarDefaultTypes.Custom)\n {\n defImg = System.Web\n					.HttpUtility\n					.UrlEncode(customImageUrl);\n }\n\n url = String.Format(\n url,\n hash.ToLower(),\n defImg,\n size.ToString());\n\n tagBuilder.MergeAttributes(htmlAttributes);\n tagBuilder.MergeAttribute(\"src\", url);\n\n return tagBuilder.ToString(TagRenderMode.Normal);\n }\n }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\nSo you can see I\'m not storing the hash of the email address, instead I am going to pass in the unaltered string. I didn\'t want to have another piece of data to update when the user changed their email address so the Gravatar() method takes an email address and encodes it using a call to FormsAuthentication.HashPasswordForStoringInConfigFile(), which is awesome ( Thanks Jon, you rock!).\n\nAlso, I\'m not sure if this is a no-no or what, but I did put the extension class under the System.Web.Mvc namespace. This was mainly a convenience (read: laziness) thing and can be easily changed.\n\nAlright so we have some code now, let\'s take a look at how it can be used in our views.\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>\n &lt;%= Html.Gravatar(\n 	Model.Email, // the email address\n 	50, // size, in pixels of the avatar\n 	GravatarDefaultTypes.Identicon,\n 	null,\n 	new RouteValueDictionary(new {\n 		style = \"vertical-align: middle;\"\n 	})\n )%> <br />\n <b> &lt;%= Model.UserName %> </b>\n</code></pre>\n\nLet\'s see how that looks.\n\n<img src=\"http://wpup.codeimpossible.com/2009/04/user-avatar.png\" alt=\"user-avatar\" title=\"user-avatar\" width=\"84\" height=\"81\" class=\"size-full wp-image-378\" />\n\nBooyah, avatar support in 55 lines of code. As always, if I screwed up or there is a better way to do this, please let me know.', '2011-05-01 03:34:44', 0, '')[0m

The SyntaxHighlighter stylesheet is included at the end of the page html source and my custom css is at the top, so even though the SyntaxHighlighter styles have a lower higher <a href=\"http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/archives/css_specificity_wars.html\">css specificity</a> - my styles will never override them because <a href=\"http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp\" target=\"_blank\">CSS is processed top-down</a>.  <em>from \"CSS Introduction\" @ w3schools:</em>\n<blockquote><strong>What style will be used when there is more than one style specified for an HTML element?\n</strong>\nGenerally speaking we can say that all the styles will \"cascade\" into a new \"virtual\" style sheet by the following rules, where number four has the highest priority:\n<ol>\n	<li>Browser default</li>\n	<li>External style sheet</li>\n	<li>Internal style sheet (inside the &lt;head&gt; tag)</li>\n	<li>Inline style (inside an HTML element)</li>\n</ol>\nSo, an inline style (inside an HTML element) has the highest priority, which means that it will override a style declared inside the &lt;head&gt; tag, in an external style sheet, or in a browser (a default value).</blockquote>\nAt this point I began thinking that it was pointless to try any more and that I should just accept that my code blocks would forever be indented by 45 pixels.\n\nHowever, I\'m way too stubborn to admit defeat, and after spending a night reading about css specificity and trying some crazy hacks of my own, I realized that my problem was simple. <strong>I just wanted the code to be farther to the left</strong>.\n\nSo my solution was equally simple (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam\'s_razor\">Occam\'s Razor</a> baby!): tell the outer container to allow overflow and position the child relatively and to offset it by the distance I wanted.

That\'s not good. See the WebResource.axd request that has the same icon as the Default.aspx file? That means that a bad request was sent for an embedded resource and - most likely recieved a 404 page back instead of the javascript file, which caused our syntax error.\n\nOk, so how do we figure out which WebResource reference caused the problem? Well, the only way that I have come up with so far, is to manually copy and paste each WebResource.axd url from the html source of the page to the address bar and navigate there. The pages that give return a file download are ok and the ones that don\'t will return a 404 page in the browser.\n\nAfter finishing this long process of elimination, I found the resource request that was causing my headache:\n<pre class=\"brush:html\">/WebResource.axd?d=MaCiPhUUtdXNj16OOucV5e5lHCBZO...SNIP...</pre>\nSo how do we figure out which resource has embedded this troublesome URL into our html source?

Attributes on the methods. <cite>- Jeff Atwood (stackoverflow episode #54)</cite>\n</em>\n\nThis instantly piqued my interest and I completely zoned out for the rest of the podcast: caught up in working out the details of how I could do this for my own Asp.net MVC projects. \n\nComing up with the actual attribute code was easy; writing the code to set up all the Routes using only data defined in by the attribute was tricky.\n\nBeing new to attributes, and reflection in general, it took me a few hours until I had a very basic demo working. However, I was really starting to like where it was going.\n\n<p class=\"right side-note callout-green\">\nAs a side note: There are lot of \"helper\" classes and objects in the route attribute project (it feels cluttered to me) and the reason I did this was to make the code in AssemblyExtensions.GetRoutes() easier to read.\n</p>\n\nAfter a few nights of <a href=\"http://twitter.com/digitalBush/status/2121662803\" target=\"_blank\">Mtn Dew and convenience-store cherry-pie</a> I finished the rough code, tests and demo project (included in this blog post) and I was starting to realize that:\n\n<ol>\n	<li>Using the attributes is more declaritive and it feels cleaner</li>\n	<li>Having your route information right above your actions is incredibly useful</li>\n	<li>I had no more need to switch back and forth between your controller and the Global.asax.cs</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>How does it work?</h2>\nAll of the real work for the RouteAttribute is done in the AssemblyExtensions class. This class uses extension methods to augment the System.Reflection.Assembly class with two methods: GetControllers() and GetRoutes().\n\nGetRoutes is the only method that is used by other classes, I made GetControllers public for unit testing.\n\n<h3>GetRoutes()</h3>\nGetRoutes\' first order of business is to make a list of data that it will need to build out all the routes for the assembly it was passed. After thats done GetRoutes will loop through the collected route data, build up each route and add it to the dictionary that will eventually be returned.\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>\nnamespace CodeImpossible.Mvc.Routing\n{\n public static class AssemblyExtensions\n {\n\n public static BindingFlags ActionFlags = \n BindingFlags.Instance | \n BindingFlags.Public |\n BindingFlags.DeclaredOnly;\n\n public static IList&lt;ControllerMetaData&gt; GetControllers(this Assembly assembly)\n {\n var controllers = assembly.GetTypes().ToList().FindAll(type =>\n {\n var isValidController = type.IsClass &&\n type.IsPublic &&\n type.IsSubclassOf&lt;Controller&gt;();\n\n var hasValidActions = type.GetMethods(ActionFlags).ToList().Any(m =>\n {\n var valid = false;\n if (m.ReturnParameter != null && m.ReturnParameter.ParameterType == typeof(ActionResult))\n {\n valid = m.GetAttributesOfType&lt;RouteAttribute&gt;().Count > 0;\n }\n\n return valid;\n });\n\n return isValidController && hasValidActions;\n }).Select&lt;Type, ControllerMetaData&gt;((t) => new ControllerMetaData(t)).ToList();\n\n return controllers;\n }\n\n public static IDictionary&lt;string, Route&gt; GetRoutes(this Assembly assembly)\n {\n var Routes = new Dictionary&lt;string, Route&gt;();\n\n var data = (from c in assembly.GetControllers()\n from a in c.GetActions()\n from r in a.Data\n select new\n {\n ControllerName = c.Name, \n ActionName = a.Name, \n RouteData = r, \n RouteParams = a.Params\n }).ToList();\n\n foreach (var r in data)\n {\n var route = new Route(r.RouteData.RoutePath, new MvcRouteHandler());\n route.Constraints = new RouteValueDictionary();\n route.Defaults = new RouteValueDictionary(new { \n controller = r.ControllerName, \n action = r.ActionName \n });\n\n if (r.RouteData.RequireRouteParams && r.RouteParams.Count() == 0)\n {\n throw new MissingRouteParameterException(\"Unknown\", r.RouteData.RoutePath);\n }\n\n var missingParams = new List&lt;ParameterMetaData&gt;();\n\n if (r.RouteData.RequireRouteParams)\n {\n missingParams = (from p in r.RouteParams\n where r.RouteData.RoutePath.IndexOf(\"{\" + p.Name + \"}\") == -1\n select p).ToList();\n }\n\n if (missingParams.Count > 0)\n {\n var param = missingParams.First();\n throw new MissingRouteParameterException(param.Name, r.RouteData.RoutePath);\n }\n\n foreach (var param in r.RouteParams)\n {\n if (param.Data != null)\n {\n if (param.Data.DefaultValue != null)\n {\n route.Defaults.Add(param.Name, param.Data.DefaultValue);\n }\n\n if (param.Data.Constraint != null)\n {\n route.Constraints.Add(param.Name, param.Data.Constraint);\n }\n }\n }\n\n Routes.Add(r.RouteData.Name ?? r.RouteData.RoutePath, route);\n }\n\n return Routes;\n }\n }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>Getting the Routes into the RouteTable</h2>\nSlapping route attributes onto your classes and methods is all well and good but it doesn\'t mean anything unless we can get those routes into the RouteTable object easliy. Originally I had the code to add the routes looking something like\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>\nvar routes = Assembly.GetCurrentExecutingAssembly().GetRoutes();\n\nroutes.ForEach(r => RouteTable.Add(r));\n</code></pre>\n\nThis, although pretty easy, wasn\'t as readible as I wanted. So I added some extension methods to the RouteTable class:\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>\nRouteTable.Routes.IncludeRoutesFromAssembly();\n</code></pre>\n\nI think both of these are much clearer than doing:\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>\nRouteTable.Routes.MapRoute(\"Root\",\n \"\",\n new { controller = \"Test\", action = \"GetItem\", id = 1 });\n\nRouteTable.Routes.MapRoute(\"Search\",\n \"Search/{id}\",\n new { controller = \"Test\", action = \"Search\", id = 1 });\n//.. SNIP ...\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>Using the RouteAttribute and RouteParamAttribute</h2>\nIn the controller \"TestController\" below there are three actions: Index, FindByText, and GetItem. Using the RouteAttribute and RouteParamAttribute makes it pretty clear that the routes for FindByText and GetItem are the same but use different RouteContraints. \n\nSo a request for /Test/Search/Hello will go to FindByText while /Test/Search/1 will go to GetItem. Also notice how GetItem has a default value of 2 for the id argument.\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>\npublic class TestController : Controller\n{\n\n [Route(RoutePath = \"Test\")]\n public ActionResult Index()\n {\n\n return View();\n }\n\n [Route(RoutePath = \"Test/Search/{query}\")]\n public ActionResult FindByText(\n [RouteParam(Constraint=\"[a-zA-Z]{1,}\")]\n string query)\n {\n\n return View();\n }\n\n [Route(RoutePath = \"Test/Search/{id}\")]\n public virtual ActionResult GetItem(\n [RouteParam(Constraint=@\"\\d{1,}\", DefaultValue=2)]\n int id)\n {\n\n return View();\n }\n}</code></pre>\nThere is support for binding multiple routes to the same action; just add another Route attribute:\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>\n[Route(\"Products/Search/{id}\")]\n[Route(\"Products/{id}\")]\npublic ActionResult GetProductById(int id)\n{\n return View();\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>Downsides or things I haven\'t gotten to yet</h2>\nJust some gotchas that I think people might raise issue with.\n\n<strong>All of your controllers must inherit from the System.Web.Mvc.Controller class</strong>\nThis isn\'t really a big deal because if you are using Asp.net MVC then you really should inherit from the Controller class, but for those of you using FubuMVC or another MVC framework this should be easy to change.\n\n<strong>Attributes can be ugly</strong>\nI know a few people out there are against attributes but I think that this is a more than acceptable use because it made the code much easier to understand.\n\n<strong>Reflection can be slow</strong>\nHonestly, when I first started working on this demo I was sort of turned off by the use of Reflection myself. After weighing the possible performance loss against the gains in both readability and maintenance I decided this was definitely worth it. I haven\'t performance tested this code so, as always YMMV.\n\nAs always, if I screwed up or there is a better way to do this, please let me know in the comments.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.box.net/shared/1q4bq5scuz\" target=\"_blank\">Download the source code mentioned in this blog post.</a>', '2011-05-01 03:34:44', 0, '')[0m

I chose javascript simply because it was something I knew I could get running pretty quickly. \n\nNext I\'ll need some variables.

I\'ve got my start variable (dropping the 0 in favor of more readable code), my end counter, and my \"where-am-i\" variables: current, previous, temp and my sum variable.\n\nObviously we\'ll need some kind of loop. How about a while loop?\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>\nwhile( current <= end )\n{\n	\n}\n</code></pre>\n\nCool.

Problem 3 asks you to find the largest <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_factor\">prime factor</a> of the number 600,851,475,143.\n\nMy solution is pretty simple but it works:\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>\nvar getLargestPrimeFactor = function(num)\n{\n var factors = [];\n for ( var f = 2; f &lt; num; f++ )\n {\n if( num%f == 0 )\n {\n factors.push(f);\n num = num /f;\n }\n }\n factors.push(num);\n return factors[factors.length-1];\n};\n\nalert( getLargestPrimeFactor(600851475143));\n</code></pre>\n<a title=\"Try this code!\" href=\"http://beta.jsvudo.com/76cc38\" target=\"_blank\">Try this code!</a>\n\nYou may have noticed that there isn\'t a check for a factors <del>optimus</del> primeness anywhere in there.\n\nThats because the <code>getLargestPrimeFactor()</code> function is dividing the number by it\'s smallest factor, and the smallest factor for any number is always prime so when we run out of factors we\'ve got the largest prime factor. Yeah, that\'s pretth cool IMO.\n\nI read the discussion threads for problem 3 after I solved it and I was surprised that hardly anyone removed the prime checks from their code.\n\nSo, problem 3 is in the bag and I feel pretty good about coming up with the prime check optimization (or lack thereof).

After you\'re satisfied with the number of results click the stop button and note the \"Average Query Time\"</li>\n	<li>Follow <a href=\"http://code.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/using.html\">Googles directions for switching your DNS over</a> and then repeat steps 1-3 above</li>\n</ol>\n\nAfter I did those steps I had an average of 213ms for my ISPs DNS and 190ms for Googles. So in my case Google is definitely faster; a 12% increase in DNS lookup performance. So it looks like I\'ll be switching over. As for you, well, your mileage may vary. \n\nDid you switch to google? Stay with your current provider? Or maybe you went with OpenDNS? Let me know how it worked out for you in the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n', '2011-05-01 03:34:45', 0, '')[0m

I\'ve just finished this step and thought that this data might be useful, so I\'m posting it here. \n\nCurrently the fields included in the data dump are:\n\n<code>\n[namespace] = The namespace that the class exists in (ex: System.Collections.Generic)\n[class_name] = The name of the class (ex: StringBuilder)\n[assembly_fullname] = The display name of the assembly (ex: mscorlib, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089)\n[assembly_file] = The full file path to the assembly (ex: C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v2.0.50727\\System.dll)\n[framework_name] = The framework that uses this class, for this dump they will all be \'Microsoft .Net\'\n[framework_version] = The framework version that uses this class (ex: v.2.0.50727)\n</code>\n\nThe .sql file takes about 18 seconds to run to completion on my AMD Athlon X2 2.53ghz machine with 4gb of RAM.\n\nIf you\'re curious about how I generated the .sql file, below is the code I used to find all the classes. It\'s not pretty but then again it was just meant to get the data into the database.

Whenever I\'ve made my resolutions known in the past its always been in a passing conversation with a friend of family member. I never wrote them down or tried to keep track of them once the conversation was over so this year I decided to post them publicly to give me that extra bit of motivation, and also I\'ll be able to check back here throughout the year and see how I\'m measuring up.\n\nThese are in no particular order.\n\n<strong>I need to grow more as a professional.</strong> Last year I went to my first conference (MSDEVCON) and it was a total blast. I met a lot of truly awesome and intelligent people and learned a billion things that I didn\'t know before. After that I attended Stack Overflows Dev Days in Boston and it was the same experience all over again. This year My goal is to start attending more conferences/events (as many as I can afford with time and $$$) to grow myself as a professional.\n\n<strong>Make more mistakes. </strong>I made my fair share of mistakes in 2009 and (more importantly) I learned a lot from them: about myself, my skills, and what I am capable of. I\'m addicted. I\'m going to put myself more out in the open and make some more mistakes so I can learn a lot more in 2010.\n\n<strong>I need to lose at least 25lbs this year.</strong> I\'ve let myself go over the past few years and it\'s time to take my health more seriously. 25lbs probably doesn\'t sound like a lot and honestly it\'s a lot less than I need to lose but I\'ve never been good at staying fit so hopefully I achieve this goal relatively early and am able to keep the weight off the rest of the year.\n\n<strong>No more sugary drinks, especially soda.</strong> I\'m looking at you Mt. Dew. I\'m not sure what happened but between the end of the year work rush and the holiday (fr)antics I\'ve been downing soda like it\'s going out of style. Time for that to end.\n\n<strong>Eliminate debt.</strong> This goal is a bit lofty but my goal is to eliminate 80% of all my debts this year. This is going to be a tough one to pull off, what with the recent job change and our new house but it\'s needed.\n\n<strong>Finish </strong><em><strong>something</strong></em><strong>. </strong>I started <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/myrkat\" target=\"_blank\">way</a> <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/jsoq\" target=\"_blank\">too</a> <a href=\"http://codeimpossible.com/jsoq\" target=\"_blank\">many</a> <a href=\"http://whatdidijusteat.com\" target=\"_blank\">side</a> projects last year, and I finished... none. Not one project I started in 2009 saw what I would call a 1.0 release. Time to crap or get off the pot. I aim to crap. My goal will be to promote at least 2 of the projects I started in 2009 to a 1.0 release this year.\n\n<strong>More play.</strong> Tamara and I didn\'t get a vacation last year and we are dying for some time away. This is going to be tough with all my debt elimination going on but the more debt I get rid of the more I can save.\n\n<strong>More sleep.</strong> Tamara reminds me all the time how little sleep I get ( about 4-5 hours a night at most ) and it really started to show during the holidays.

Fix our site or you\'ll never see Spartacus again.\"</blockquote>\n\nAnd before you have time to wonder why you ever named your dog \"Spartacus\" to begin with (i mean <strong>come. on.</strong>), you\'re off in debug hell. You load the site and see all sorts of weird errors:\n\n<code>“$().ready is not a function”</code>\n\n<code>“$(document) doesn’t support this property or method”</code>\n\nOr my personal favorite: \n\n<code>“null is null or not an object”</code>\n\nYou open up FireFox, activate FireBug, load the console, and type “alert($)”, press run, and instead of seeing the expected jQuery function:\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>\nfunction (E, F) {\n return new (o.fn.init)(E, F);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\nYou instead get:\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>\nfunction $(element) {\n if (arguments.length > 1) {\n for (var i = 0, elements = [], length = arguments.length; i < length; i++) {\n elements.push($(arguments[i]));\n }\n return elements;\n }\n if (Object.isString(element)) {\n element = document.getElementById(element);\n }\n return Element.extend(element);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\nOr even:\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>\nfunction $(id) {\n return document.getElementById(id);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<strong>DOH!</strong> Looks like another javascript library has been loaded and has overwritten the <code>$()</code> shortcut for jQuery. Woe is I. Why can’t we all just get along?!? \n\nWell, we can’t stop people from including their favorite javascript libraries, but what we can do is prevent our code from suffering as a result. We’ll need a nice, big beefy, bodyguard to make sure our code isn’t messed with while it’s out clubbing with Prototype, Scriptaculous or even MooTools (who invited <em>him</em>??!?).\n\nHere’s what our bodyguard function will look like\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>\n( function($) {\n\n} ) ( jQuery );\n</code></pre>\n\nSo what this does is call our anonymous function and pass the <code>jQuery</code> object. This will scope ‘$’ to within our little function so we won’t step on anyone else’s toes (and they won’t bump into us while we’re on the dance floor and spill our drink everywhere). Okay, I think I\'ve taken the clubbing metaphor far enough.\n\nBasically this will allow our code to run and use the <code>$</code> shortcut for JQuery as if it were loaded without any of these other libraries on the page. \n\nHere is what the completed code would look like:\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>\n&lt;script src=\"http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.1/jquery.min.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;\n&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&lt;script src=\"http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/prototype/1.6.1.0/prototype.js\" type=\"text/javascript\">\n&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;script src=\"http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/scriptaculous/1.8.3/scriptaculous.js\" type=\"text/javascript\">\n&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&lt;script type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;\n( function($) {\n // we can now rely on $ within the safety of our “bodyguard” function\n $(document).ready( function() { alert(\"nyah nyah! I’m able to use \'$\'!!!!\"); } );\n} ) ( jQuery );\n\n//this will fail\n$(document).ready( function() { alert(\'fail?\'); } );\n&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\nI love using this simple self-calling anonymous function style when working with jQuery because it saves me from typing <code>jQuery()</code>, which really does look a lot more ugly than using the <code>$()</code> shortcut. It also protects my code from any scoping issues and lets the code function normally when <a href=\"http://docs.jquery.com/Core/jQuery.noConflict\">jQuery is put into no conflict mode</a>. \n\nMy opinion, if you\'re doing work in jQuery on sites that you don\'t control 100%, you should be using this method to protect your code and your clients.\n\n<strong>Updated: changed link for jquery to use 1.4.1 at the google CDN (tsk, tsk, tsk I was using the googlecode.com link)</strong>', '2011-05-01 03:34:45', 0, '')[0m

It\'s still in really early stages and I\'m not quite sure about it\'s actual usefulness but I\'m learning a lot about JavaScript and having a ton of fun along the way!\n\nJsoq deals with arrays a lot. About 95% of it\'s use cases involve either looping through, altering, or creating arrays. Having a ton of <code>for</code> loops in my code just seems so... not right. For loops have always seemed dirty to me. They just aren\'t elegant enough. \n\nHere is your normal, average, everyday <code>for</code> loop in Javascript.\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>\nvar array = \"1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10\".split(\',\');\n\nfor(var i = -1, l = array.length; ++i &lt; l;) {\n alert(array[i]);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\nThis works. It\'s reliable and gets the message across. But what if we needed to loop over an array and get all the items that matched a condition? Using a <code>for</code> loop the code could look something like:\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>\nvar array = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4 ];\nvar results = [];\nvar condition = function(i) { return i%2 == 0; };\n\nfor(var itt = -1, len = array.length; ++itt &lt; len;) {\n	if( condition(array[itt]) ) {\n		results.push(array[itt]);\n	}\n}\n</code></pre>\n\nThis does work, I\'ve written code like this many times before, and while <em>technically</em> there isn\'t anything wrong with it I think there is still room for improvement.\n\nJsoq is going to be handling arrays all over the place so the solution to this problem <em>needs</em> to be simple.\n\nHere\'s what I need:\n<ul>\n	<li>to loop over an entire collection and perform an action on each item.</li>\n	<li>If that action produces a result, the item is to be pushed into an array and returned to after the loop is done</li>.\n	<li>Also: it needs to be readable, someone else coming along should be able to determine what this thing is doing without too much difficulty. So I had my work cut out for me. </li>\n</ul>\n\nA few hours later I had a decent function that I could use to replace a lot of the <code>for</code> loops I had. After some more refactoring I was able to wipe them all out and replace them with calls to <code>enumerateOver()</code>. Here is the latest version from source control:\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>\nfunction enumerateOver(collection, work) {\n	var result = [], val = [];\n	\n	if (isArray(collection)) {\n		try {\n			for (var i = -1, l = collection.length; ++i < l;) {\n				result = work(collection[i], i);\n				if (typeof result !== \"undefined\" && result != null) {\n					val.push(result);\n				}\n			}\n		}catch (e) {\n			if (e != jsoq.$break) throw(e);\n		}\n		\n		if (val.length > 0) {\n			return val;\n		}\n	}else {\n		try {\n			val = work(collection, 0);\n		}\n		catch (e) {\n			if (e != jsoq.$break) throw(e);\n		}\n		if (typeof val !== \'undefined\') {\n			return val;\n		}\n	}\n	return result == null ? [] : result;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\nAnd here is the code to replace the <code>for</code> loops above, re-written to use <code>enumerateOver()</code>\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>\nvar results2 = enumerateOver(array, function(i, c) {\n return i%2 == 0;\n});\n</code></pre>\n\nSo by implmenting this function I was able to come up with a more readable, testable and streamlined codebase. Is this suitable for everyone? Definitely not, but I did it for a few reasons:\n\n<ol>\n	<li>Like I mentioned before. I\'ve never been at ease with <code>for</code> loops and being able to replace them all with calls to a single function was a huge win for me</li>\n	<li>The normal use-case didn\'t fit right. I needed to not only iterate over arrays but also return the results of work performed on those items. Doing this the \"regular\" way just wouldn\'t work (see previous reason)</li>\n	<li>I thought this was a fun problem to solve</li>\n</ol>\n\nIf you have any feedback, good, bad, or indifferent add a comment!', '2011-05-01 03:34:45', 0, '')[0m

I originally started with a batch file. I know, I know. It\'s my comfort zone. Too many years of not having something like powershell at my finger-tips.\n\nAfter about 10 minutes of fighting with batch language limitations <a href=\"http://twitter.com/codeimpossible/statuses/19095201324\">I decided to move on and try my hand at using powershell</a> to help automate the developer environment setup.\n\nSo I borrowed some code from Adam Weigerts blog to bypass the need for the gacutil (and the .Net Framework SDK, a whopping 100mb download!). Once I had this, I just had to come up with the code to recurse over all the .dll files that are stored in sub-folders within a \"Source Dependencies\" folder. \n\nFrom concept to finish I think this took me about an hour to come up with, I\'m no programming super soldier so anyone who is doing windows development should be able to throw together a powershell script to automate their common, repetitive and annoying tasks.\n\nThe code is included below, I\'ll be adding to it as the project goes on, pushing in some other environment setup features (dev db creation/sync would be the next feature for this). Now that I\'ve taken a swing at PowerShell I\'m really happy with it and I really am sorry it took so long for me to use it.\n\nIf you\'re still automating things with Batch files, you\'re missing out.

I use AutoHotKey at both home and work to perform some simple (and some complex) text replacement macros. In this post I\'ll take you through a few simple examples of what AutoHotKey can do to show why I think this is an essential item for your developer batman utility belt.\n\nYou can download AutoHotKey from its website, <a href=\"http://www.autohotkey.com/download/\">here</a>.\n\n<strong>The really, really basic example - replacing text: </strong><br />\nHere is a sample script that I use to write out my work email address\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>\n:*:@work::jbarboza@wakefly.com\n</code></pre>\n\nIt looks a little confusing but trust me, it\'s really simple. The * tells AHK that this script is an \"instant replacement\" and AHK should not wait for the spacebar to be pressed. \"@work\" as you\'ve probably guessed is the trigger and \"jbarboza@wakefly.com\" is the replacement text. Note: AHK doesn\'t care about the @ symbol in <code>@work</code>, it\'s only there for consistency with my other email triggers.\n\n<strong>Another simple example - fixing common misspellings</strong><br />\nI suck at spelling. I make spelling mistakes <strong>all the time</strong>. These script lines show how I auto-correct a few of my more common spelling mistakes.\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>\n:*?:.cm::.com \n:*?:.ocm::.com\n</code></pre>\n\n<strong>AutoHotKey can also run applications:</strong><br />\nAHK isn\'t just for replacing text. The built-in scripting language can do a multitude of things, from manipulating selected text, gathering user input via prompts and using it in script output, even automate applications.\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>\n#f::Run Firefox\n</code></pre>\n\nThis script will run Firefox when you press [Windows Button] + f. The # symbol in AHK is a shortcut for the windows key. You can use other shortcuts like ^, and ! for CTRL and ALT respectively.\n\nThis is just a small sampling of what AHK can do, if you\'re interested in learning more about the AHK scripting language check out the <a href=\"http://www.autohotkey.com/docs/Hotkeys.htm\">HotKey Introduction in the AHK Documentation</a>, the <a href=\"http://lifehacker.com/tag/autohotkey/\">AHK articles on Lifehacker</a>, or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutoHotKey\">the AutoHotKey wikipedia page</a>.', '2011-05-01 03:34:45', 0, 'AutoHotKey is a free, open-source macro-creation app for Windows.

To understand the for/in loop we\'ll have to dive deeper into objects and arrays and how JavaScript <del datetime=\"2010-10-19T05:29:37+00:00\">mis</del>treats them.\n\n<strong>Objects in JavaScript</strong><br />\nIn most other programming languages these days, everything is an object. You can see this in current languages like C# where everything inherits from System.Object or in Ruby where you can assign properties and methods to anything at will.\n\nJavaScript is an object oriented language but it\'s implementation of objects is a little different from other languages. In JavaScript every object (every thing) is an array - a special array called an \"associative array\". If you\'re a C# developer think <code>Dictionary&lt;string, object&gt;</code>. If you\'re a python developer then you\'re already familiar with this concept. <br />\n<br />\nSo in JavaScript:\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>\nvar x = {\n something: \"hi\"\n};\n</code></pre>\nand\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>\nvar y = [];\ny[\"something\"] = \"hi\";\n</code></pre>\ndefine the same thing. Both objects will have a \"something\" property with the value \"hi\".\n\n<strong>Need more proof?</strong><br />\nTry the following:\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>\nalert( typeof( new Array() ) );\n</code></pre>\n\nThis will alert \"object\". Huh?\n\nYup, more proof that an array is just an object with properties named \"0\", \"1\", \"2\" etc. This means that\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>\nvar a = {\n 0: \"hi\",\n 1: \"there\"\n};\n</code></pre>\nand\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>\nvar b = [ \"hi\", \"there\" ];\n</code></pre>\nare the same exact thing. <a href=\"http://beta.jsvudo.com/3f40176\">Try it out!</a>\n\n\n<strong>Alright, that is insane but why the problem with for/in?</strong><br />\nWhen you use a for/in on an object in javascript you are looping over the keys in the key/value collection that makes up that object. So doing\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>\nvar x = {\n prop1: \"test\",\n prop2: \"test\"\n};\n\nfor(var p in x ) {\n alert(p);\n}\n</code></pre>\nwill alert \"prop1\" followed by \"prop2\". Using a for/in doesn\'t try to treat the object as an array, it enumerates each property (or key) in the object.\n\nNow you should start to see why for/in is generally a bad idea in JavaScript - that is, unless you <strong>want</strong> to loop over the properties of an object. \n\n<strong>Another fun fact</strong><br />\nThe for/in loop isn\'t guaranteed to alert \"prop1\" before \"prop2\". The properties will be enumerated in whatever order the interpreter returns them in.\n\nSo to summarize, unless you want to enumerate an objects properties, and you don\'t care about their order, avoid using the for/in loop in your JavaScript code.', '2011-05-01 03:34:46', 0, 'JavaScript has a lot of good parts and bad parts but the for/in loop seems to walk the grey area in between.

Open this guy up in your favorite text editor - don\'t worry it\'s just xml - and find the part that looks like this:\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>\n&lt;Code Language=\"csharp\"&gt;\n &lt;![CDATA[$signature$\n{\n	$GetterAccessibility$ get \n	{ \n		$end$throw new $Exception$(); \n	}\n	$SetterAccessibility$ set \n	{ \n		throw new $Exception$(); \n	}\n}]]&gt;\n&lt;/Code&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\nReplace this xml with the xml below and you\'ll be good to go after a quick restart of Visual Studio!\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>\n&lt;Code Language=\"csharp\"&gt;\n &lt;![CDATA[$signature$ { $GetterAccessibility$ get; $SetterAccessibility$ set; }]]&gt;\n&lt;/Code&gt;\n</code></pre>', '2011-05-01 03:34:46', 0, 'This week I\'m finding that there is a lot less pain involved in getting Visual Studio 2010 to do things my way than I thought - like no pain at all.')[0m

Processing PostsController#update to json (for 68.187.213.182 at 2011-04-30 22:52:53) [PUT]
  Parameters: {"format"=>"json", "action"=>"update", "id"=>"211", "content"=>"\n  <p>A few weeks back <a href=\"http://codeimpossible.com/2010/09/20/spot-the-bug-forin-and-javascript/\">I wrote a post about a bug that can occur when you improperly use a for/in</a> style loop in javascript. </p>\n\n<p>This is particular quirk is one that I find myself explaining to a lot of devs when they start using JavaScript, especially if they are coming from C# (with it's foreach loop having a similar syntax).</p>\n\n<p><strong>\"I do not think that means what you think it means.\"</strong><br>\n<br>The for/in loop in JavaScript is powerful but it definitely doesn't do what you probably think it does. To understand the for/in loop we'll have to dive deeper into objects and arrays and how JavaScript <del datetime=\"2010-10-19T05:29:37+00:00\">mis</del>treats them.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Objects in JavaScript</strong><br>\n<br>In most other programming languages these days, everything is an object. You can see this in current languages like C# where everything inherits from System.Object or in Ruby where you can assign properties and methods to anything at will.</p>\n\n<p>JavaScript is an object oriented language but it's implementation of objects is a little different from other languages. In JavaScript every object (every thing) is an array - a special array called an \"associative array\". If you're a C# developer think  <code>Dictionary&lt;string, object&gt;</code>. If you're a python developer then you're already familiar with this concept. <br>\n<br><br>\n<br>So in JavaScript:\n<br></p><pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>\n<br>var x = {\n<br>    something: \"hi\"\n<br>};\n<br></code></pre>\n<br>and\n<br><pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>\n<br>var y = [];\n<br>y[\"something\"] = \"hi\";\n<br></code></pre>\n<br>define the same thing. Both objects will have a \"something\" property with the value \"hi\".<p></p>\n\n<p><strong>Need more proof?</strong><br>\n<br>Try the following:\n<br></p><pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>\n<br>alert( typeof( new Array() ) );\n<br></code></pre><p></p>\n\n<p>This will alert \"object\". Huh?</p>\n\n<p>Yup, more proof that an array is just an object with properties named \"0\", \"1\", \"2\" etc. This means that\n<br></p><pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>\n<br>var a = {\n<br>    0: \"hi\",\n<br>    1: \"there\"\n<br>};\n<br></code></pre>\n<br>and\n<br><pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>\n<br>var b = [ \"hi\", \"there\" ];\n<br></code></pre>\n<br>are the same exact thing. <a href=\"http://beta.jsvudo.com/3f40176\">Try it out!</a><p></p>\n\n<p><strong>Alright, that is insane but why the problem with for/in?</strong><br>\n<br>When you use a for/in on an object in javascript you are looping over the keys in the key/value collection that makes up that object. So doing\n<br></p><pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>\n<br>var x = {\n<br>    prop1: \"test\",\n<br>    prop2: \"test\"\n<br>};<p></p>\n\n</code><p><code>for(var p in x ) {\n<br>    alert(p);\n<br>}\n<br></code></p></pre>\n<br>will alert \"prop1\" followed by \"prop2\". Using a for/in doesn't try to treat the object as an array, it enumerates each property (or key) in the object.<p></p>\n\n<p>Now you should start to see why for/in is generally a bad idea in JavaScript - that is, unless you <strong>want</strong> to loop over the properties of an object. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Another fun fact</strong><br>\n<br>The for/in loop isn't guaranteed to alert \"prop1\" before \"prop2\".

Open this guy up in your favorite text editor - don&#39;t worry it&#39;s just xml - and find the part that looks like this:</p>\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">\r\n<code>&lt;Code Language=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;\r\n &lt;![CDATA[$signature$\r\n{\r\n	$GetterAccessibility$ get \r\n	{ \r\n		$end$throw new $Exception$(); \r\n	}\r\n	$SetterAccessibility$ set \r\n	{ \r\n		throw new $Exception$(); \r\n	}\r\n}]]&gt;\r\n&lt;/Code&gt;\r\n</code></pre>\r\n<p>\r\n	Replace this xml with the xml below and you&#39;ll be good to go after a quick restart of Visual Studio!</p>\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">\r\n<code>&lt;Code Language=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;\r\n &lt;![CDATA[$signature$ { $GetterAccessibility$ get; $SetterAccessibility$ set; }]]&gt;\r\n&lt;/Code&gt;\r\n</code></pre>\r\n<p>\r\n	&nbsp;</p>\r\n' WHERE `id` = 214[0m

In JavaScript every object (every thing) is an array - a special array called an &quot;associative array&quot;. If you&#39;re a C# developer think <code>Dictionary&lt;string, object&gt;</code>.

You load the site and see all sorts of weird errors: <code>&ldquo;$().ready is not a function&rdquo;</code> <code>&ldquo;$(document) doesn&rsquo;t support this property or method&rdquo;</code> Or my personal favorite: <code>&ldquo;null is null or not an object&rdquo;</code></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tYou open up FireFox, activate FireBug, load the console, and type &ldquo;alert($)&rdquo;, press run, and instead of seeing the expected jQuery function:</p>\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">\r\n<code>function (E, F) {\r\n    return new (o.fn.init)(E, F);\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\r\n<p>\r\n\tYou instead get:</p>\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">\r\n<code>function $(element) {\r\n    if (arguments.length &gt; 1) {\r\n        for (var i = 0, elements = [], length = arguments.length; i &lt; length; i++) {\r\n            elements.push($(arguments[i]));\r\n        }\r\n        return elements;\r\n    }\r\n    if (Object.isString(element)) {\r\n        element = document.getElementById(element);\r\n    }\r\n    return Element.extend(element);\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOr even:</p>\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">\r\n<code>function $(id) {\r\n    return document.getElementById(id);\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>DOH!</strong> Looks like another javascript library has been loaded and has overwritten the <code>$()</code> shortcut for jQuery. Woe is I. Why can&rsquo;t we all just get along?!? Well, we can&rsquo;t stop people from including their favorite javascript libraries, but what we can do is prevent our code from suffering as a result. We&rsquo;ll need a nice, big beefy, bodyguard to make sure our code isn&rsquo;t messed with while it&rsquo;s out clubbing with Prototype, Scriptaculous or even MooTools (who invited <em>him</em>??!?). Here&rsquo;s what our bodyguard function will look like</p>\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">\r\n<code>\r\n( function($) {\r\n\r\n} ) ( jQuery );\r\n</code></pre>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo what this does is call our anonymous function and pass the <code>jQuery</code> object. This will scope &lsquo;$&rsquo; to within our little function so we won&rsquo;t step on anyone else&rsquo;s toes (and they won&rsquo;t bump into us while we&rsquo;re on the dance floor and spill our drink everywhere). Okay, I think I&#39;ve taken the clubbing metaphor far enough.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBasically this will allow our code to run and use the <code>$</code> shortcut for JQuery as if it were loaded without any of these other libraries on the page. Here is what the completed code would look like:</p>\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">\r\n<code>\r\n&lt;script src=&quot;http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.1/jquery.min.js&quot; type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;/script&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;script src=&quot;http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/prototype/1.6.1.0/prototype.js&quot; type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;/script&gt;\r\n&lt;script src=&quot;http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/scriptaculous/1.8.3/scriptaculous.js&quot; type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;/script&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\r\n( function($) {\r\n    // we can now rely on $ within the safety of our &ldquo;bodyguard&rdquo; function\r\n    $(document).ready( function() { alert(&quot;nyah nyah! I&rsquo;m able to use &#39;$&#39;!!!!&quot;);  } );\r\n} ) ( jQuery );\r\n\r\n//this will fail\r\n$(document).ready( function() { alert(&#39;fail?&#39;); } );\r\n&lt;/script&gt;\r\n</code></pre>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI love using this simple self-calling anonymous function style when working with jQuery because it saves me from typing <code>jQuery()</code>, which really does look a lot more ugly than using the <code>$()</code> shortcut. It also protects my code from any scoping issues and lets the code function normally when <a href=\"http://docs.jquery.com/Core/jQuery.noConflict\">jQuery is put into no conflict mode</a>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMy opinion, if you&#39;re doing work in jQuery on sites that you don&#39;t control 100%, you should be using this method to protect your code and your clients.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Updated: changed link for jquery to use 1.4.1 at the google CDN (tsk, tsk, tsk I was using the googlecode.com link)</strong></p>\r\n", "controller"=>"posts", "summary"=>"Ever been working on a customer's site, writing some really awesome jQuery, you deploy it, and everything is awesome.

Okay, I think I&#39;ve taken the clubbing metaphor far enough.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Basically this will allow our code to run and use the <code>$</code> shortcut for JQuery as if it were loaded without any of these other libraries on the page. Here is what the completed code would look like:</p>\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">\r\n<code>\r\n&lt;script src=&quot;http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.1/jquery.min.js&quot; type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;/script&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;script src=&quot;http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/prototype/1.6.1.0/prototype.js&quot; type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;/script&gt;\r\n&lt;script src=&quot;http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/scriptaculous/1.8.3/scriptaculous.js&quot; type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;/script&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\r\n( function($) {\r\n // we can now rely on $ within the safety of our &ldquo;bodyguard&rdquo; function\r\n $(document).ready( function() { alert(&quot;nyah nyah! I&rsquo;m able to use &#39;$&#39;!!!!&quot;); } );\r\n} ) ( jQuery );\r\n\r\n//this will fail\r\n$(document).ready( function() { alert(&#39;fail?&#39;); } );\r\n&lt;/script&gt;\r\n</code></pre>\r\n<p>\r\n	I love using this simple self-calling anonymous function style when working with jQuery because it saves me from typing <code>jQuery()</code>, which really does look a lot more ugly than using the <code>$()</code> shortcut. It also protects my code from any scoping issues and lets the code function normally when <a href=\"http://docs.jquery.com/Core/jQuery.noConflict\">jQuery is put into no conflict mode</a>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	My opinion, if you&#39;re doing work in jQuery on sites that you don&#39;t control 100%, you should be using this method to protect your code and your clients.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>Updated: changed link for jquery to use 1.4.1 at the google CDN (tsk, tsk, tsk I was using the googlecode.com link)</strong></p>\r\n' WHERE `id` = 187[0m
