					<h2 class="bio">A short biography</h2>
					<div class="bio">
						<p>My first computer was an IBM PC 5155 which weighed more than I did. My first experience with 
						programming came just after Windows 95 was released. I got a copy of Visual Basic 4.0 for my 
						birthday and I spent that entire summer locked in my room writing code and reading every book I 
						could get my hands on. It was awesome.</p>
						<p>By the time I got to college I had been coding on my own for about 4 years. I had used Php,
						javascript, visual basic, and some c++.</p>
						<p>College gave me more exposure to C++ and Visual Basic. I also got to work with Java and C for the
						first time. After a 2 years I left college to take a job at Cyphermint in 2004. I learned really fast that there is a huge difference 
						between writing code in a classroom and shipping a professional software product. At Cyphermint I
						gained a lot of experience in JavaScript, Java, and C#.</p>
						<p>Since then, I've used C# and the Microsoft technology stack at every job but recently I've found time 
						to pick up other languages; like Python and Ruby. I've written two applications	in Ruby using Rails (jsVudo 
						is one and the other is in a closed beta for launch later this summer).</p>

						<ul class="jobhistory">

								<h4>Wake}fly Inc <small><a href="http://www.wakefly.com">( website )</a></small></h4>
								<em>July 2009 - present</em>
								<p>
									<strong>Heska.com</strong> <a href="http://heska.com/">( website )</a>:
									Worked on implementing site in Kentico CMS, won Kenticos "Kentico Site of the Year" award in the Healthcare category for 2010 ( <a href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/2010/12/prweb8037317.htm">read more</a> ).
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>Wakefly Libraries</strong>: Lead creation and development of Wakefly libraries, a group of libraries that are used by the development staff in various projects. 
									Each project is built automatically using CruiseControl.net and nant and all projects are unit-tested on each check-in. Users can create a release using CruiseControl and 
									each release is tagged in svn, its binaries packaged using NuGet and deployed to our internal NuGet server. Each developer can then add a reference
									to the newly deployed binaries via the NuGet visual studio add-in.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>Wakefly WebHealth</strong>: Lead creation and development of Wakefly WebHealth, an Asp.net Mvc web application and custom <a href="http://code.google.com/p/elmah">Elmah</a> module that allows customer websites to

								<h4>ScerIS Inc <small><a href="http://www.sceris.com">( website )</a></small></h4>
								<em>July 2007 - July 2009</em>
								<p><strong>ScerIS E-forms</strong>: 
									Hired to be the lead developer on the ScerIS E-Forms application. The E-Forms application allowed businesses to eliminate paper waste by implementing their paper forms
									into an electronic document system using a form designer. <br />
									<br />Users could then fill out these forms and, using a basic work-flow system, route the documents to other users. 
									The system featured an electronic signature system where users could sign certain sections of documents (or the entire document) and any changes to these signed sections
									would invalidate those signatures.
								</p>
								<p><strong>WCF Centralized Authorization & Authentication</strong>: 
									I was also tasked with designing and developing a centralized authorization & authentication system in WCF using Linq to objects, generics and extension methods. This 
									system was used by all ScerIS applications for authentication and authorization of users.

									<br />
									The PayCash Remote acted as a network and local system health monitoring system. With PayCash Remote 
									Cyphermint was able to reduce maintenance costs to kiosks by 60%. PayCash Remote also handled deployment of kiosk updates and collection of kiosk analytics data. The remote updating
									system was used to transmit and install software updates on the kiosks and the analytics data was used to allow clients to measure traffic on the kiosk applications.
								</p>
								<p><strong>Kiosk Application Framework</strong>: 
									I also Architected a Microsoft .Net based in-house development framework: the Kiosk Application Framework, which cut development time for kiosk applications by 40%. It served as a 
									"Rails" or "Django" type framework for us to build our kiosk applications.

								<p>
									“Syntax Error, Line: 2, Char: 0?. How many of you out there have seen this error while working on a web project? Usually it’s because of a forgotten semi-colon or parenthesis in some external javascript file. But sometimes it’s something more sinister… Something darker, dirtier and just a little bit more evil.

								<p>
									So lately I’ve been working on a project using Asp.net MVC and TDD to build a web 2.0 application. It’s a twitter-like application that I started a while ago but due to my failure to test everything I lost about 99% of my work and had to start over from scratch.

								<em>Posted March 4th, 2010 | 382 views</em>
								<p>
									The other day I had to alter the stylesheets in a child IFrame when a user selected an item from a drop-down. My first draft was pretty ugly, it ivolved getting the DOM from the child IFrame (by getting it’s contentWindow or contentDocument property) then getting the of the DOM and looping over all the child items… yuck!
